Theyll be thirsty.47Put five more men on north wells.48How many sheep shallI have to kill for them?4970?50Give them a hundred.51Mecca must keep hername for hospitality.52And ten lambs for the leaders.53Bread and water,do the poets have in the Hakims house?54Where verse and prose arenightly put to slaughter.55And...and the bread, I swear in there,56is thinner than the water!57Oh...open the space, open the space,you lovers of poetry,58to Abu Sufian, willing and which...59patron of the arts.60When Abu Sofyan invites the poet in,61their joy is kit and love is kin.62Where wines and cakes abound,63the skills of Abu Sofyan.64All revels and all songs begin,65when Abu Sofyan invites the poet in.66From the silkworms of China, my lady.67A pleasure to the limb...68and as my lady can see,a ravish to the eye.69Yes, 7 lengths.7020 dinars.71Abu Sofyans wife?7215.73Oh, gold! The gods of theKaaba have their needs,74their upkeeps.75Who is that man who stood there,who looked into my soul?76Carry me away from here.77Why must Muhammad come down here?78Why dont you stop him?79He is your nephew.80Maybe he will change.81Change?82He is 40 years old.83Its unnatural...84with a rich wife, he couldafford the best of Mecca.85Yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave.86It is unnatural!87For a man who dares torisk the anger of AlUzza,88who keeps our health.89Manat, the god of our prosperity.90Allat, the god of ourfamily and tribes.91and Hubal...92Hubal, who starts our caravansand predicts our fate.93To challenge the gods within earshotof the gods is dangerous.94Unreasonable.95Rebellious, blasphemous.96Yes, Im afraid Muhammadwill harm himself.97I am always sadwhen the great fair is over.98I might not see the next one.99Abu Talib! Abu Talib!100Catch your breath, Zaid!101Has Muhammad come downfrom Mount Hira yet?102Hes been up there three days.103No, no, I havent seen him.104Khadijah hoped he might havecome to you on his way home.105Then hes still up there.106Three days.107Im afraid for him on the mountain,108because...109I dont know what it means.110iMen see the world too wellfrom a mountain.i111Muhammad! Read!112In the name of thy Lord who createdman from His sensitive drop of blood.113Who teaches man what he knows not.114Read!115Hes still trembling under the blanket...116but he has spoken.117Zaid! What happened tomy nephew on the mountain?118He was alone, in the cave.119Suddenly, an angel came in to him.120The angel said Read!121Muhammad replied I can not read.122The angel commanded again Read!123In the name of thy Lord,124who created man fromHis sensitive drop of blood,125who teaches man what he knows not.126Read!127Who knows if it was Gabriel?128It could have been a dream.129When Muhammad was coming fromthe mountain, he saw Gabriel plainly.130In the shape of a manstanding on the horizon.131Wherever he looked,132upon every turn ofhis head he saw him.133And Gabriel said to him again,134I am Gabriel...135and you Muhammad,136are the Messenger of God.137Who has he told about this?138His wife,139and Ali,140and, his friend Abu Bakr.141And you?142I am his adopted son.143Be careful to whom you talk.144Tell him his uncle who protected himwhen he was a child, will protect him still.145After all...146they say the God of Moses147spoke to him out of a burning bush.148If you do not restrainyour nephew then we will.149Hes dividing the city,heart against house.150Hes dividing the generationschild against parent.151The young are listening to him.152He attracts the young.153We are Arabs,we obey our fathers.154Our children cannot be our teachers.155How can we accept that the manwe met in the street yesterday156can be some Gods Prophet today?157Dead bones can live again, he says158because He who created man159can also make man returnfrom the dead, he says!160The Gods might leave us andgive their benefits to another city.161Tell him...we will give himauthority, position,162and keys to the Kaaba,163and money, what money he wants.164Tell him, we will givehim anything he wants.165Muhammad, spare yourself...and me.166Do not put a greater burden onan old man that he can bear.167In your childhood, you were in my arms.168I cannot now see you hurt.169If you refuse them...170they will hurt you.171He said this to me172Were they to put the sun in myright hand and the moon in my left,173I would not renounce my message,174which is from God.175When I am dead,you may do as you please,176but whilst Im alive,you will obey your father!177Why did you hurt our father?178If I were drunk every dayand played dice every night,179youd call it high spirits!180You will be more mybrother than you are now!181You are all my children.182Ive given you everything I could,183but it seems not to be enough.184Muhammad gives me more,185he give all the world more.186Get him out of here, father!187Its not Waleed or me,its our father.188You tortured him.189Wait Hudayfa, wait!190How can they sayits an invention, Musab,191when it isnt new?192In Mecca, its new.193Yet, God has said it all before...194to Noah, Moses, Jesusto all the Prophets,195but people changed it,turned it, forgot it.196Now God said it to Muhammad again...197and it is new again.198What is it?199Its Jafar.200What have you brought with you?201The very word of God.202When the sun is overthrown.203When the stars fall.204When the mountains vanish.205When the camels big withyoung are abandoned.206When the wild beasts are herded together.207When the seas rise.208When the souls are sorted.209When the female infantwho is buried alive,210asks for what crime she was killed.211When the books are opened.212When the sky is torn away,213then...214every soul...215will know what it has done.216Were you there, Jafarwhen God gave him these words?217Dawn is coming up.218Ammar, you first,219then you Jaafar.220Ammar!221You kept your mother awakeall night with worry.222Im sorry father.223Where were you?224Have you been with Muhammad again?225What will happen now?226Forgive him, it wasmy fault, I did it.227That God has helped us all our lives.228But it fell...229it could not even help itself.230What talk have you been listening to?231The real god is unseen.232Hes not made of clay.233Ammar, we see the godsin the Kaaba every day.234Im afraid for you.235Youre listening to peoplewho will hurt you.236Im listening to Muhammad, mother.237Muhammad is generous, yes.238He gives, he shares,239hell pass no man without a smile,240but he is spreading dangerous ideas.241Dangerous ideas,that no man should start?242That the rich should not afloat the poor?243The strong should not oppress the weak?244Are these dangerous ideas?245Girls should not be forced into marriage,246but be able to choose or refuse.247By only tonight, he said248Stop the burial of newborn girls.249I was fortunate, alwaysfortunate with your mother.250Yes, but you know that you and Inearly never met, Yasser.251And you were nearly never born.252I was to be buried,253like my two sisters,254but my father couldnt do it.255He couldnt do it the third time.256When the second girl was being...257when my father was putting sand over her,258she took hold of his finger,the way a baby does.259He told my mother afterwards,260that it was a minute...261before the tender little grip eased...262and he dared take away his hand.263When I was born,264my father ran out of the house265screaming that he couldnt do it again,266that he could never do it again.267Sumayyah, it is the custom.268But its wrong.269The gods that let suchthings be are no gods.270I promised to go to Muhammadshouse mama, we pray there.271Yes! He is a good man.272Yes...yes, you go.273Two men are following him.274Read? Muhammad canneither write nor read.275But he can speak.276What did you say?277He can speak?278Well, so can you so now,you speak up young man.279What does Muhammad say, umm?280They are Gods words, not his.281Which gods?282What words?283A speaking god?284Your Muhammadspeaks only to himself.285When God reveals Hismessage to Muhammad,286he remembers every word287then he tells it to those who can write...288this is the Quran.289Muhammad has starvedhimself into dreams.290He hides under a blanketwith his eyes shut.291His eyes are shutbut his heart is open.292You! Kick him for his cleverness.293There is no purpose in that.294Doesnt Muhammad realize, welive by giving housing to the gods?295We own the Kaaba.296Every year, the tribes ofArabia come here to Mecca297to pray and to buy from us.298Now, were we to replace300 Gods with just one?299Whom we cannot even see, who issupposed to be in Taif and Medina,300here in my house,301in Jerusalem, on the moon?302Where would Mecca be then?303The gods are both ourworship and our revenue.304You cannot buy and sell God.305Young man, you areclose to the whip.306Ammar, be sensible boy.307I have a question.308Muhammad teaches you,a slave is equal to his master.309This black Bilal, who Ipaid money for...equal to me?310Yes Muhammad says...311before God, all men are asequal as the teeth of a comb.312This is a very pleasant ideato slaves and beggars.313It gives them pretensions.314Bilal!315Teach this man the differencebetween the Lord of Mecca and a slave.316Take that whip.317Lash his face, toteach his mouth a lesson.318Whip him!319Whip him!320Cut him!321Whip him!322Do it Bilal!323Obey them!324They will kill you!325See what anarchy they bring!326Theyve even infected our slaves!327If youre human enoughto have gods...328...remember!329They are the gods of your owner!330I bought your humanity Bilalwhen I bought you.331You will be corrected!332One, one God.333There is only one God!334Who is stronger now?335Your masteror this one god of yours?336One God.337There is only one God.338Bring the stones!339One God.340One...341...one God.342Crush him!343Break him!344Have you finished with him?345There is only one God!346 iOne God!i You could swear the slave was preaching!347 iOne God!i Lord Umaya!348Abu Bakr will pay a 100dinars for this slave.349Wait now!350Its against our social orderto sell a slave during his correction.351The offer is to Lord Umaya!352200!353If the price of slaves is raised,354we shall have to bailourselves next year.355Take him!356He is no use to me anymore!357Kill him or take him,Im finished with him!358We are declaring ourselves.359God has told his messengerto declare Islam to all men!360Open the windows!361Let the world hear!362We are coming out of the darkness!363Hear well the word of God!Hear well the messenger of God!364There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.365There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.366We have come into light,367join us in the march to the Kaaba!368God is most great,God is most great!369God has no partner!370We have come into light,371join us in the march to the Kaaba!372Muhammad and his rebellioncalled Islam are coming out,373to foul our godsand dethrone religion.374Dont let them reach the Kaaba!375Throw them back!

Hit me back if you dare!419I affirm my nephews religionand I say what he says!420Whoever has the courage to fight,fight with me!421Muhammad, when I hunt the desert at night...422I know God...is not kept in a house.423Who would have thought that Hamza,424Hamza above all,425with his wine drinking, lion hunting...426would come to join Muhammad?427The more we attack him,more they seem to join him.428Where does he find his words?429I dont know.430How can an illiterate mango up on a mountain431and come down three days later,blazing with poetry?432If it were just poetry...433he says its God.434How do we fight someone whosestrength we do not understand?435Muhammad promises heaven,trees in the skies.436So naturally hes found an audience.437Then we must make that audienceless eager to listen to him.438We will begin with the weaker ones.439Your turn!440Have mercy!441Stretch her!442Who is your God?Answer me!443Say it!444Say Hubal is your God!445Say it!446There is only one God447and Muhammad is the messenger of God!448Oh my god!449Ammar!450Your father and motherare the first martyrs of Islam!451You are promised paradise!452How much are you men prepared to suffer?453The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca.454If you stay,455they will kill you...456one by one.457Muhammad says that in Abyssinia,there is a Christian King.458No man is wronged in his country.459We must leave now, today.460Uthman!461God be praised!462Let us go.463We found their tracksand followed them,464but they just disappeared!465They were there...in the desert, under the vultures466and you let them escape you!467Escape? They vanished!468If Muhammad has stayed,then only the weakest have gone.469Weak or strong,theyll blacken our name.470Were honest merchants,we buy and sell in good faith.471We cannot afford scandal.472Abyssinia...473Amr!474You are a friend of Annajashi, the king?475Yes.476Can you use that friendship?477I think I can bring them back...478yes.479Abyssinia...480Rise up Amr.481Please, nothing you may askfor that we will not give.482Lion of Judah, I...483I dont know where to begin.484You have our friendship,485begin there.486Certain runaway slaves have escapedfrom us into your kingdom.487Slaves go back, as you no doubtwould returned our slaves to us.488There are however somefree men among them...489rebels.490Rebels?491Disturbance in Arabia,why am I not informed?492They are rebels in religion.493At one time or another,all religions were rebellions.494The bodies of slaves of the worldand beaten are disposal.495But as Jesus Christ as our shepherd,496the souls of men are his sheep.497These are Arabs who have betrayedthe religion of their fathers.498They follow a lunaticthey call...a Prophet.499But I cannot put souls intochains without hearing them.500Good, theyre stiffnext well hang them.501Do you not bow to yourselfbefore your prophet?502Muhammad is a man,503we kneel only to God.504Where are Muhammads miracles, Jafar?505If he were a prophet,hed light the sky with miracles506Indeed, this is true.507God has given his prophetsthe signs of miracles508that we may recognize them.509The miracle of Muhammadis the Holy Quran.510A book! A book!511Written by an illiterate,attributed to God.512I think the emperor has had enough!513Im mindful of petty costs.514When God set down tongues of fireupon the heads of Christs apostles,515so they could speak themany languages of the world516that they knew not before.517But do such miracles happen in our times?518Ive heard enough!Youve made a poor case.519When we suffered persecution in Mecca,520Muhammad told us,go to Abyssinia,521the land of the righteous king,where no man is wronged!522What they call persecutionwas fair punishment,523that is order, now...524Why did your prophet send you to me?525Because you believe in the bookof the one God as we do.526He sent us because in your heart,God will protect us.527Talking with him is likedrawing water from a mirage.528But theyve now belay that duty onme to listen to them, my friend.529Go on!530For years, we worshipedwood and stone,531images of our own manufacture.532We lived in ignorance of God.533We had few earthly lawsand no heavenly laws.534The rich neglect the poor.535And the natural pity of man,536whereby he lifts his brotherup when he has fallen...537is described by them asupsetting social order!538To this inhumanity,has come a man...539whom God chose...540and in that we believe.541Youve overcome, I begyou to collect yourself.542I speak of the messenger of God.543Muhammad teaches usto worship one god,544to speak truth,545to love our neighbors as ourselves,546to give charity,even a smile can be charity.547To protect women from misuse,548to shelter orphans...549and to turn away fromgods of wood and stone!550I cannot keep still andhear this blasphemy!551We are an ancient civilization...552to call our gods wood and stoneis to speak ignorantly of them.553The idol...the form,is not what we worship,554but the spirit that resides within the form.555I agree that idolatry is notalways fully understood.556Thank you.557Now let me bring him back to the women.558God made woman to be theproper companion of man.559She is different but equal.560Equal?!561We buy them.562Feed them, clothe them,563use them, discard them...564women equal to us?565God created man fromone male and one female.566Amr, you must respect in allwoman the womb that bore you.567Why are your 300guards so tonguetied?568While this only guard is eloquent.569God has spoken to us before...570through Abraham, Noah, Mosesand through Jesus Christ.571Why should we be so surprised that Godspeaks to us now through Muhammad?572Who taught you those names?573They are named in the Quran.574I knew Muhammad when hewas an orphan minding sheep!575And we knew Christ as a carpenter.576What Christ saysand what your Muhammad says577is like two raised from the same land.578They are lying to you,they deny Christ.579You worship three gods, they say.Father, Son and Holy Ghost, they say.580What do you say of Christ?581They say God cannot have a son.582Christ is not the Son of God.583Speak to me of Christ.584We say of Christ whatour prophet has taught us...585that God cast his holy spirit intothe womb of a virgin named, Mary586and that she conceivedChrist, the Apostle of God.587The Apostle he says,not the son, not the son!588What does your miracle, your Quran,say of the birth of our dear Lord Jesus Christ?589May I relate the words?590Come closer to me.591In the name of God,most gracious, most merciful.592Relate in the book, the story of Mary.593How she withdrew from herfamily to a place in the east.594How we sent to her ourangel, Gabriel, who said595I am a messenger from your God596to announce the birthof a holy son to you.597She said How shall I, Mary, have a sonwhen no man has touched me?598And Gabriel replied599For your Lord says, it will happen.600We appoint him as a sign onto man...601and a mercy from us.602It is a thing ordained.603The difference between us and you,604is not bigger than this line.605Not for a mountain of goldwill I give them up to you.606You may live in Abyssinia, in peace,607for as long as you wish.608May Gods blessings be upon you,609when you return.610lntolerable!611Mohamed disturbs evenour foreign alliances!612Very well!613We will make a foreigner of him!614Abu Talib,615has his arms around him.616Very well!617We will throw uncleand nephew out.618In one bundle, his whole family out.619We will expel them from ourselves.620No merchant may trade with them.621No land remain to them.622No roof shelter them.623No beggar beg for them.624No woman marry them.625Until they renounce, they cant.626iThese were the worstyears of Muhammads life.i627iFor three years they suffered the hunger,thirst, cruelty of the open desert.i628iBut the year of grief was still to come,i629iwhen Khadija, Muhammadswife for 24 years, died.i630iWhen Abu Talib,his old Protector, died...i631iwith his last breath, Abu Talib,i632itried again to reconcileMecca and Muhammad.i633He never asked more from you...634...than one word.635One...636one God.637If it were only a question of one word,we would have given him ten words.638But the word he wants,would dethrone all the gods.639You were afraid even to hear him.640iWith the death of his uncle,Muhammad has now lost all protection.i641iHe was no longer safe in Mecca.i642iAlone with Zaid, his adopted son,he went to the hillside town of Taif.i643iHe asked to be taken in,to be allowed to preach.i644iBut the

Yes, why?462 Come off it... What do you know?463In those years you were in Naplesbeing a loafer with posh girls464and writing your only novelette.465I didnt notice that historywas being made.466Novelette? It was a masterpieceof Italian literature!467I confirm that Jep and civil vocationnever got along,468he was lazy and the other hyperactive.469Romano, stop sucking up to your idol,youre pathetic!470The Human Apparatuswas a narrowminded, frivolous book471and pretentious too, like its title.Jep knows that.472 Thats why he stopped there. Sorry, what about you then?473I tried changing thingswith literature.474I wrote 11 novels, and a book aboutthe Partys official history.475Youre forgetting your contributionto that reality show...476Girl Farm.477Television can bea very formative experience!478I always go when Im invited.479I get my hands dirty, I try things...480I dont spend my life being a snob.481Are you saying that a sociallycommitted writer is advantaged,482and safeguarded,compared to a novelist483who deals with, how can I say...with feelings?484Of course she is!485The cause someone commitstheir life to isnt secondary.486Like creating a family,487dedicating oneself with sacrifice toraising and educating ones children.488Eusebio and I have four children,we plan the future together.489I work hardto be both a mother and a woman,490but at the end of the day, I feelIve done something important.491So if we dont have children we shouldcontemplate the idea of suicide?492 I dont mean you, of course. She means me.493Dadina, I admire you greatly.Youre a badass.494Do you use badassin any of your 11 novels?495Yes, I do, I try to be modern.496 Modernity is badass. De gustibus.497What great conviction!498Should I envy you or be repelled?499Yes, I have convictions.Im 53...500 Youd never know.

Eusebioloves Giordano, everyone knows.534He has for years.535They lunch every dayat the Pantheon, under the coat rack,536like sweethearts under an oak tree.You all know but turn a blind eye.537Your dedication to your children,with all the sacrifices entailed...538You work all week in TV,go out every night,539even on Mondays, when popperdealers dont even venture out.540Youre never with your children,not even on the long holidays you take.541And plus you have a butler, a waiter,542a cook, a chauffeurwho drives the kids to school,543three babysitters, so...544how and when exactlydo you make any sacrifices?545These are the untruths and fragilityIm talking about.546Stefania, mother and woman.547Youre 53, with a life in tatters,like the rest of us.548Instead of acting superiorand treating us with contempt,549you should look at uswith affection.550Were all on the brink of despair,551all we can dois look each other in the face,552keep each other company,joke a little, dont you agree?553Son of a bitch!554Egidio!555Bastard!I havent seen you in 30 years!556 I need to talk to you.

I wish, wed have a common interest.581She doesnt even drink beer.582I dont know what she spendsher money on, shes always broke.583 Do I seem like a loser? No, why?584Because I can hear myself talk,I sound like a loser.585Im nearly 70 and I have to worktill 6 in the morning every day.586I swapped cocaine for heroin15 years ago.587What an asshole!A heroin junkie at 50!588Could I be more of a loser?589But Im not important,its her I worry about, I love her.590And Im no loser there,Im a father.591And like all fathers, Im worried.592Whatll she do in a few years?593She cant be a stripper at 50!594 Why dont you help her?

Yes.1296Now you tell me?Howll I fucking find the Odescalchis?1297 Whats wrong? The Saints assistant called me.1298The Saint would likeCount Odescalchi to come too,1299he treated her like familywhen she was here.1300 Do you know him? Of course, but hes not in Rome.1301All the nobles are in London,at Philips greatnieces wedding.1302Hold on...Lets call the Colonnas from Reggio.1303The nobles for hire? Theyre dead.1304 Nonsense, theyre immortal. But theyre not the Odescalchis.1305The Saint wont even notice,70 years have gone by!1306The Colonnas are true aristocrats,and aristocrats all look the same.1307True...1308iThis piece of furniturelooks great..i1309iId never have thoughtof putting it in the bathroom.i1310iIt looks great,like a new bathroom!i1311iWell done, Andrea!i1312Count Colonna speaking.1313Yes, we are available.1314For tonight...1315Short notice would entaila small surcharge.1316Our rate is 250 euros per personfor the evening.1317Plus the cost of the car hire.1318No, Im not sure...1319This would be somewhathumiliating for us...1320We are willing to be hired...1321as the Colonnas from Reggio.1322But as for pretending to bethe Odescalchis...1323I dont know...1324We were at war for two centuries.I feel its immoral.1325Let me talk it over with my wifeElisabetta.1326All right, maam.1327For this time, well go along with it.1328But we would appreciate it1329if you would supplementthe contribution.1330Cut at least twelve pieces of rabbit!1331Set aside the kidneys, liver, head...1332Gently brown it.1333Dont forget thyme,laurel leaves, rosemary...1334Then red wine, Ligurian olives...pine nuts.1335And after an hour,you have Ligurianstyle rabbit!1336Sister Maria, what conventare you staying at?1337Actually, were at the Hassler Hotelat the Spanish Steps.1338To be honest, Sister Mariafinds it uncomfortable.1339Never heard the Hasslerdescribed as uncomfortable!1340Its very comfortable but Sister Mariaisnt used to sleeping in a bed.1341She sleeps on the floor,in a cardboard bed.1342Do you have any visits planned?1343Sister Maria will climb St JohnsBasilicas Scala Sancta on her knees.1344 Have you? Id have liked to, but...1345I have a bad knee...1346Orthopaedic problemsare unimportant,1347compared to the plenary indulgencegranted by the Scala Sancta.1348Thats true!1349Another specialityof mine is lamb with...1350Does Sister Maria still helpthe sick?135122 hours a day, every day.1352She washes them, feeds them...You ought to see her.1353Despite her age,she doesnt walk, she runs.1354Shes inexhaustible!1355Now shes tired, but thats becauseshes not with her patients.1356How old is she?1357Shell be 104 in October.1358 Thats impressive. I thought she was older!1359Longevity too, like all things,is not accidental.1360About Sister Marias interviewwith Jep...1361Her interview?1362There must be a mixup...1363Sister Maria hasnt givenany interviews since 1971,1364after the reasonfor her mission in Chad,1365was misunderstood by some.1366Of course, but consideringher admiration for Jeps work...1367You told me she enjoyedThe Human Apparatus.1368She found it beautiful and fierce.1369Like the world of men.1370Great! There would be no riskof any misunderstanding,1371Sister Maria can review the text...1372 No, Im sorry. Dont insist.1373I dont wish to raise any false hopes,1374theres absolutelyno question of any interview.1375Sorry, but why do you always answer?1376Why not let Sister Maria talk?1377Madam...1378I took a vow of poverty.1379And you cant talk about poverty...1380you have to live it.1381Such true and real words!Powerful words!1382Do you need anything, madam?1383 She needs the bathroom. Its on the left.1384The change of dietisnt good for her.1385Sister Maria, in Mali, only eats40 grams of plant roots a day.1386Me too sometimes, in the evening,as a light meal,1387I have some splendidroots with lemon.1388You clean the rootsby scraping them with a knife1389and you cut them into small chunks...1390Cardinal, remember when we metat that wedding?1391You were there too...1392I felt the need to ask youabout matters close to my heart.1393Matters regarding faith...1394regarding the strengthof spirituality...1395But then you got distracted.1396You can ask me now.1397 No, I dont see the point. Why?1398Id be very disappointed to discoverthat you have no answers.1399Im only saying its a possibility...1400I think that...1401Never mind...1402I apologise for earlier.1403Im afraid I was somewhat offensive.1404There is one questionI really want to ask you.1405Are the rumours about you true?1406That you were a truly great...1407exorcist?1408See you at the office.1409Sister Maria...1410Sister Maria!1411Wheres Sister Maria?1412I thought she was with you.1413 She was with you. Yes, but then she went to you.1414Were going, thank you and goodbye.1415Sister Maria!1416 Sister Maria! Sister Maria!1417 Have you seen her? Shes not there.1418Saint...1419Sister Maria!1420Saint...1421Saint!1422Shes called Sister Maria.1423Sister Maria...1424Where has that bitch got to?1425These 550 euros1426have come at just the right time.1427It was a lovely evening too.1428Lovely evenings are others, Alceste.1429Sister Maria!1430Sister Maria!1431My goodness!1432Come, Elisabetta, lets go to bed.1433You go ahead, Im going upstairsfor a moment.1434Dont be late.1435Countess,we must put a stop to this.1436Ill lose my jobif I let you in every night.1437This isnt your home anymore.1438 Its a museum now.

I cannot be any prouder.186Naksu is training Uk.187Yul.188Did you hear?189There is a commotion in the capital.190What happened?191Master Kang from Daegangtongunsuccumbed to his illness.192But rumor has it193that some assassinsattacked him last night.194My uncle and Master Heorushed over to his funeral.195What if more assassinslike Naksu have appeared?196THE LATE KANG MANCHEON197Why can we not offer our condolences?198Transporting precious goodsis our family business.199But if people find outthat the man of the house200was killed by some assassins,we could become jobless.201We told everyonehe died of a contagious disease.202That is why no one can enter.203We understand.204Have you found any evidencethat could help us find the assassins?205Has an autopsy been carried out?206Master Kang was stabbed to deathin front of our eyes.207An autopsy is unnecessary.208We will cremate his body tonight.209That soon?210It is unfortunate.211But we must hurrybefore the rumor spreads.212I am certain Master Kang would havealso wanted this for his family.213That is unacceptable.214If you cremate his body,215there will be no evidencethat will link to the assassins.216This is a family matter.217I understand that you are worried.218But the leader of Songrimdoes not need to concern himself with it.219An autopsy is needed.220Postpone the cremation.221Has Songrim gone as far as to meddlein other families funerals?222We are not meddling.223I am simply trying to preventthe new man of the house224from making an irreversible mistake.225Why is Songrims leader against this?226What gives you the right?227Only recently did Naksu attackthe mages in the capital.228Now, new assassins have emerged.229There could be a link between this caseand Naksu who used sorcery.230That is why I am interfering.231There was no sorcery involved.232I witnessed it all.233How can you be so sure without an autopsy?234The new man of the housedoes not want an autopsy.235Jin Mu! You have no say in this.236We have the right to interfereif there are suspicions237of sorcery being involved.238Do you not agree, Lady Jin?239I believe240the Assistant Gwanju is right this time.241The familys heir witnessedMaster Kangs death.242And he has no choice but to hide itdue to their family business.243No evidence hintedat sorcery being involved.244So I do not think Songrimshould cause a commotion here.245I just want to protect his honor.246Please let us proceedwith this funeral discreetly.247Jin Mu does not hesitateto look down on Songrim now.248Why are they so against the idea?249 It is suspicious. By the way,250I had no ideaLady Jin would take Jin Mus side.251She used to hate her halfbrother.252I was truly pleased when you took my side.253Look.254Songrim had no choice but to back downonce we joined hands.255How close are you to finding Buyeon?256We searched all the areasaround Lake Gyeongcheondaeho257for blind girlswho were around Buyeons age.258I have been doing that for ten years now.259To be honest,260I believe I foundthe whereabouts of Buyeon.261A young girl had washed upnear the lake ten years ago.262 Is that so? However263She was long dead.264Mother, I doubt that was her.265I told my men to dig up her grave.266If Buyeon truly is dead,267I will bring her bodyback to you at all costs.268That is unacceptable.269Bring my daughter back alive.270I will, so please calm down.271We will find her alive.272Did you take a good look?273They will be your motherand younger sister.274Do you think275they will think that I am their daughter?276You are dressed277like Buyeon when she was young.278But I am not sure if Hogyeong will agree.279Then being welldressed280will not benefit us.281I must look shabbier and more pathetic.282She is a mother who has lost her daughter.283I can only win her heartby pulling at her heartstrings.284Yes.285You are right, Soi.286I will see to it287That I become a daughterof the Jin family.288You look much better now.289I tend to recover quickly.290This Hyeongong technique291Is quite elaborate.292I have my suspicionsregarding Master Kangs death.293Master Kang was powerfulwith a great mastery of spells.294But he was already sufferingfrom a fatal illness.295There was no need for anyoneto send the assassins.296Maybe someone had a grudge against him297and wanted to kill him themselves.298No.299There must be a reason300why those assassins came,although we do not know yet.301Once the soul is shifted,the former body becomes useless.302But we cannot get rid of it that easily.303In other peoples eyes,that body belongs to a powerful mage,304an administrative officer, or a merchant.305They will only suspect somethingif that individual disappears.306Naksu was the one who took care of them.307Do you mean the Shadow Assassin?308Thanks to that crazy assassin,309Songrim never suspectedthat I was making soul shifters.310Back when I was after Naksu,311I thought she was just a lunaticwho wanted to show off her skills.312That is why I never suspectedthe individuals that she killed.313Are you saying that she killed those314whose souls have been shifted by Jin Mu?315To be exact,316they must have been thosewho were discarded afterward.317Did you not saythat Naksu was Cho Chungs daughter?318Are you saying he took that little girland turned her into an assassin?319That is why I never revealed myself to her320and made her livein the mountains by herself.321I took care of herjust enough for her to survive.322But she was determinedand grew to be remarkably strong.323Because324She thought by doing soshe would be avenging her parents.325That is why she obeyed Jin Mu.326She was very useful.327Then a soul shifter ran wild before dying.328Thanks to him,329Songrim got wind of the alchemy of souls.330Once Jin Mu heard that we were after her,331he was probably afraid of getting caught.332He probably sent Naksu to Songrimdespite knowing that she would die.333Mudeok, go and get some water.334Yes, maam.335Mudeok, will you seriouslynot listen to me?336I told you to just get some rest.337Then what about you?338Did I not tell you to treat your wounds?339I stopped by Sejukwon.At least I listened to you.340Check for yourself.341I smell mugwort.342What is wrong with you?343You know I am struggling these days.I am just exhausted.344How warm.345Did you get a hot mugwort massage?346Yes. I am warm, right?347Yes. You are.348She was used for all the wrong reasonsand met a terrible death.349Naksu350I truly pity her.351You are cool now. Let me go.352 Did you change your shoes? Yes.353Did you have the foodMaidservant Kim brought?354Yes. I had already had somebefore you even mentioned them.355Well done. Mudeok.356I did not know how fascinating this was.357The yinandyang jade?358I only found out because you had given itto the Crown Prince.359How is it fascinating?360 Show me. I cannot.361I will show you362once I get yours back.363You will give it to me again364after you get it back?365Why? Will you not accept it?366I will retrieve itand place it in your hand.367This thing has unbelievable powers.368It is a relief we did not know.369You are in for a shock once I get it back.370What kind of powers? Show me.371The Crown Princefoamed in the mouth and fainted.372It was terrifying.373That makes sense. It was from Jinyowon.374It could be a lethal weapon.375Hello, Assistant Gwanju.376The leader of Songrim returned377to watch the cremation for himself.378What will you do this time around?379I am only here to observe.380This is the last timeI will ever see Master Kang.381It is my duty to see him off.382You have seen a soul shifter before,383so you will recognize the blue mark.384Check and see if Master Kangs bodyhad been used for soul shifting.385Even if we find outthat he has shifted souls,386we will not knowwhose body he has shifted into.387There is something you must doto help us find that out.388I know that you havealready mastered Chisu.389I did not hide it on purpose.390I am not scolding you.391What I am about to ask you to do392is quite dangerousand might suck away your energy.393Only thosewho have mastered Chisu can do it.394A soul shifter runs wildonce their energy is lost.395The body is still warm.396Pour your energy into him.397And make him run wild.398My lord399What is it?400He is401I will collect his bones, so step aside.402This is a soul shifter403who has been petrified after running wild.404Now that we have solid evidenceof sorcery being involved,405can Songrim take over?406Seeing how you are not disturbedand even tried to hide it,407you must have already known about this.408You already knew409that this was a soul shifterwho had run wild.410Judging by your skills,411I believe Master Kangs soulis within that body.412Then that bodys original soul413must be dead alongside your body.414Cut that nonsense!415You are running wild416after having lost blood and energy.417The more you use your skills,the faster you will become petrified.418You better stop.419You should stop here.420 Do not kill him! Kill him.421A soul shifter who is running wildis dangerous.422Thankfully, Cheonbugwan got rid of him.423Since you have helped us,424we will let Songrim take credit for this.425 My lord. Yes?426Since you said we could take credit,427we will take the body and examine it.428Be my guest.429I closed his gate of energy430to prevent more energy from seeping out.431We need to revive him and make him talk.432Will it be possible?433He is pretty much a breathing stone.Yet you want him to speak?434This will not be easy.435Are you worriedthat he may still be alive?436Even so, they will not succeed.437Perhaps it is possiblewith the help of the ice stone.438But that is their only bet.439Are you saying he can be revivedwith the ice stone?440That is correct.441And you are in possession of that stone?442You do not need to know that.443Get the assassins ready.444I will find a way445even if it means shifting the soulof a Jeongjingak mage.446 Hey, Beom. What?447Let us go.448THE ART OF HYEONGONG449PRESSING THE HEAD OF A LEOPARD STANCE450DIRECT SENDING STANCE, CAULDRON STANCE451Yul.452Uk.453Are you going to train?454Yes.455And you?456I just slashed457A soul shifter.458Master Kang who had passed away yesterdaywas a soul shifter.459Really?460But how did you know that?461If they hide their blue mark,462they can easily blend inwith other people.463But once they run wild,464there is no turning back.465They will start to petrifyas their energy seeps out.466They can prevent thatby feeding on others energy.467But once they do that,468they will no longer be humans,but monsters.469Monsters?470And it is our duty to protect this world471From such monsters.472We can also protectthe monsters from this world.473Once we keep them in check,474the world will be at peace.475Everyone had high hopes for youever since you were little,476so you thinkyou need to do something grand.477But I was told478to sit still all my life.479I will follow480my heart.481Jin Mu let Songrim find outsomething critical.482What if Songrim suspectsthe palace as well?483The Royal Palace484Is not a place he can just barge intolike he did at Daegangtongun.485If he does, I will be in danger.486Ever since Gilju died,487I was not able to feed on energy.488I am afraid I will run wild.489Could you share some of the power490of the ice stone with me?491What did you say?492The only person who can serve youdespite knowing your true face493Is only me, is it not?494Shaman.495You little496I told you never to address me like that.497Would you liketo be petrified this instant?498I know you cannot do that.499I am the only one in this palace500who knows that you are Shaman Choi,501despite residing in the Queens body.502If I die,503you will bring your sibling herefrom Jinyowon?504Furthermore,505the real Queen is residing in your body.506Should I not visit her from time to time?507Right?508It is getting difficult for me509to live in this body.510Tell Jin Mu511to shift my soulinto someone elses body once again,512Your Highness.513I understand.514You may leave.515Why are you here?516I will let you beat me.Then it will all be over.517I forfeit.518Hey, Uk!519You wanted to go before me.520And you won.521Danggo was willing to let you beat him.522How could you refuse?523I did not knowyou were this proud of yourself.524You gave me this signaland told me not to fight him.525When did I?526I only looked at you out of relief.527Then you should have signaled me.528Like this.529I did.530How could I understand that?Had I known, I would have just done it.531You only have one chance left.532What will you do?533What, are you blaming me?534Why are you getting mad at mewhen you gave that jade to him?535Are you seriouslypointing fingers right now?536How childish.537Childish? Do you want meto show you what real childishness is?538I quit.539Should I keep this up?540Mages have been guardingSejukwon since last night.541The soul shifters body must be in there.542If it was a body, they would havekept it in the secret room.543Why would they take it to Sejukwon,which is for the living?544I came by because I was curiousabout what happened to the body.545Please wait. I will inform our leader.546I heard the leader was here at Sejukwon,so I came to see him.547No one is allowedto enter Sejukwon at the moment.548Then I will meetwith Young Master Jang first.549Please tell the leader that I am here.550Jin Mu is here551to check if the soul shifterhas really died or not.552Tell him to leavesince we are still investigating.553Yes, my lord. However,someone else is here to see you.554Tell them to leave.555No one is allowed anywhere near Sejukwon.556Yes, my lord.557I will tell Maidservant Kimto leave as well.558What?559Maidservant Kim?560I will tell herthat the leader cannot meet anyone.561Hold on.562She can be an exception.563It has been a long time, Maidservant Kim.564I stayed at Gwanju Jang Gangs residencewhen I served him,565and you made mecountless delicious dishes.566You ate so much567that your rice bowl was exceptionally big.568Do you remember?569You had a huge brass bowl.570Back in the day, I was always hungry.571You must have madesomething scrumptious once again.572Yes, I have. I made these snacks myself.573Honey biscuits.I used to love them back in the day.574Yes, indeed.575Every time I gave some to youto give to the Gwanju,576you would stash a few in your pockets.577I did that because I was only allowedto eat once he finished.578In any case, I benefited a lotfrom the Gwanju while following him.579I had a chance to tastesuch delicious treats580and learn a special spell.581Does it not taste sweeterif you eat it in secret?582That is exactly why583things that taste sweet are dangerous.584Once you have a taste of it,you desire it at all costs.585You fail to distinguish586what you can have587and what you cannot.588You are hurting my feelingsby not letting me have any.589Goodness, do not be so stingy with food.590The Gwanju loved this snack.591How about his son?592Young Master Uk loveshoney biscuits as well.593Then shall we share this with him?594I have many storiesto tell him about his father.595You and Uk have nothing to talk about.596You may leave.597He just wants a biscuit.Do not be so heartless.598You are not letting me sharethe good memories with him.599But then again,600you must not want meto touch what is yours.601Wait.602Here. This was actuallyfor our young master,603but you can have it instead.604Maidservant Kim.605Do not give that to him.606If I truly wanted to have some,607I would have easily stolen a few of them.608But I will let you win.609It had been a while since we last met.I am truly sad to say goodbye.610Jin Mu used to take revenge611if he was scolded for eating something.612They were just honey biscuits.613You should have let him have them.614I just did not want him to eat615what you worked so hard to make.616Sit down.617We have not seen each other in a while.618Let us chat over some tea.619Is something wrong?620You seem quite testy.621Do not worry.622Once I have your honey biscuits,I will feel better.623Mudeok.624I need you to run an errand.625An errand? What is it?626Go to Cheonbugwan.627This just does not feel right,so I need to send this over.628Sure.629Is something going on at Sejukwon?630I do not know the details.631But I think it is relatedto last nights incident at Daegangtongun.632I heard Cheonbugwanand Songrim had a fight.633Where is Yul?634I have not seen him since last night.635He must be doing something for the leader.636Really?637I just slashed638A soul shifter.639We must strengthen Songrims boundaries.640You are forbiddenfrom leaving Songrim for the time being.641Those who have mastered Ryusu and more642shall go to Sejukwonand follow Sanghos orders.643 Yes, my lord. Yes, my lord.644Jang Uk.645You will stay here.646Everyone except for Uk647will follow Sangho and go to Sejukwon.648 Yes, my lord. Yes, my lord.649My lord.650Why am I not going?651You are exemptsince we do not need you there.652Is there something dangerous there?653Is it a soul shifter?654It is none of your concern.655Do not be curious about it.656Why are you keeping me in the darkwhen I am also a mage here?657You are excluded from everything.658If you are bored of being alone,you may leave Songrim.659Go back to your homeand do whatever makes you comfortable.660Yes, my lord.Thank you for worrying about my comfort.661Mudeok.662Let us go to Chwiseonruand have something tasty.663All the mages were headed to Sejukwon.Why are you not there?664I was told to stay out of it665and that I did not needto concern myself with the matter.666 Let us go. Maidservant Kim gave me an errand to do.667Sure. Let us go together. Where to?668Cheonbugwan.669Let us go.670I heard that you told herto shift you into another body.671Will you do that?672Then let me shift souls with that girlwho will enter Jinyowon as Jin Buyeon.673I have been a eunuch for a while,674so I do not mind a womans body.675I would like to shift my soulinto a powerful body like the Shaman has.676Shaman.677She was offended by how you reminded her678that she was a shaman dealingwith trifling affairs like divinations.679I was only stating a fact.680I was also reminded today of how I usedto beg for food and steal snacks.681They were indeed facts,but I was still unhappy to hear them.682Jin Mu wanted a honey biscuitwhile visiting Songrim,683but Park Jin did not let him have any.684Maidservant Kim was worriedhe would hold a grudge,685so she wanted me to deliver this.686Are you saying they were childish enoughto fight over some food?687Our leader has a cheap wayof tormenting others.688Why was he so picky about a honey biscuit?689You are right. He was cheap.690Here, at Cheonbugwan,691we have records of all the constellations.692I will tell the Assistant Gwanjuthat this was from the Jang family.693Please tell him thatit was from Maidservant Kim.694Tell him that we use a lot of oilin our honey biscuits695and that he should have themwith green tea.696Yes, Young Master Jang.697We also use a lot of honeyfor our honey biscuits.698He should store them in a cool placeor they will become sticky.699 Yes, Young Master Jang. Since we have brought that,700 can I take a look inside? Yes...701 Sorry? Thank you. It will not take long.702Let us go.703But704I have always wanted to visit.705Despite my father being the Gwanju,I never got to visit.706Gosh, what is that?707You have been here, right?708Your father wasa constellation recorder mage.709Did you come here for me?710You could have askedsomeone else to run the errand.711Was it notbecause you wanted to come here?712My father brought me here oftenwhen I was little.713He even showed me the platethat was recorded the day I was born.714He was a considerate father.715Come to think of it,716I believe he recorded the constellationon the day you were born.717Is that so?718The constellation of the day I was bornmust be somewhere here.719You had promised to shift my soul.720But rather, you are making me run wild.721You are no longer needed.722You will turn into a stone now.723You have gone insane.724Once night draws in, the mages will come.725Let us watch themrecord the constellations.726I heard it is a magnificent view.727I would love that, but it will betroublesome if we get caught.728Let us just go home.729Eunuch Kim has run wild.730No one must find outthat he is a soul shifter.731He is still in Cheonbugwan.We must find him before morning comes.732Yes, my lord.733I know you are here.734Do not cause any more problemsand just come out.735I will give you what you want.736Come on out.737 Come on out!

To be honest753I have company.754Mudeok, come out. He is not mad.755She is my maid.756I am Mudeok,757his maid.758You were here as well.759I thought you would be furious.760I am truly grateful for your hospitality.761Please enjoy the snacks.762Let us know if you want more.763Thank you.764Let us go.765He is a royal eunuch.766What is wrong with him?767He is a soul shifter.768Look.

9181722,"1Support us and become VIP member to remove all ads from www.OpenSubtitles.org2Its the middle of the day3the sky is dark.4Before me is the sea.5Today the sea is smooth, hefty,6with iron density7and without any force, it seems.8Between the sky and the sea9there is a very dark width.10It covers the entire horizon,11with the smoothness of a giant erasure,12the significance of an impassable difference.13And it could be scary.14In the window of my room15upright, veiled by the dark light,16my image appears.17I look outside.18The sailboats are still there, motionless,19over the iron sea,20still, in the movement of the waves21where they were taken by surprise by the fading of the wind this morning.22Im looking at myself.23I cant see well in the cold glass of the window.24The light is so dark, it looks like night.25I love you beyond my strength.26I dont know you.27Here between the horizon and the beach,28a change begins to occur29within the depths of the sea.30It is slow.31It reaches with delay.32Against my body, this cold of glass,33this dead window.34I no longer see anything of myself.35I dont see anything anymore.36Thus, I start to see again.37Before me a color is born,38that is very tense, green.39It occupies a part of the sea.40It retains a lot from her inside that color, a sea,41but very small, you see,42a sea in the wholeness of the sea.43So the light came from there,44from the bottom of the sea,45of a multitude of colors in its depth.46And the backlight47came from its gushing everywhere48where water came out.49The sea becomes transparent,50of the gleam, of the shining of a nocturnal organ.51Looks like, not of emerald, you see,52not of phosphorus, but of flesh.53Ive closed the doors and windows of my room.54I came back very quickly to write to you.55I stand there, with you, into the discovery of the beach.56I stepped away from the window, I look at myself.57The eyes are blue, they say. The hair, black.58You see? Blue eyes under black hair.59How I like you to see me!60I am beautiful, such61in my strange being.62I smile at you and tell you my name.63My name is Aurlia Steiner.64I am your child.65You are not informed of my existence.66You cant show signs to me.67Death keeps you from seeing me,68I know it.69And I see your death as a passing illusion of your life.70That, for example, of another love.71I dont care.72I am acquainted of you through me.73This morning, for example,74by this sudden terror,75without apparent purpose,76I was informed of our deep resemblance77before the chance of desire.78Sometimes other than you,79the others come.80They are occasionally as old81as you would have been.82In a world where you are not alive83they can take the place of our meeting.84By the lenght and adolescent grace of the body that I see you.85By the awkwardness of your approach, the sorrowful impatience86and, sometimes, tears.87And sometimes these calls for help too.88On the verge of pleasure it wouldnt be so far between them and you,89if, you, you as well,90if you could make a stop and wander about, 91in the streets of the port.92I give it, my body, fresh, and they take it.93They speak,94they say they love it.95They scream, they cry, they try to hurt.96I let, I let it be97to do, to penetrate , to scream of their love, to cry.98You could have been one of them99except you would have seen me.100You would have noticed this one,101this abandoned body, delivered,102this enjoyment carried away from you103and which this one does not want to return to.104The sea, it seems, her sound, at the bottom of the city.105Eyes closed, I would have asked you106How do you look? Blond?107A northerly man with blue eyes?108You wouldve hardly taken long in answering me109Blueeyed, yes, but with black hair.110Black? Yes.111I would have asked are you looking for someone?112Someone you have been told about?113You say thats right.114You would have repeated thats right, yes,115someone no way Id have recognized116and someone I love beyond my strength.117I ask118Aurlia Steiner?119He does not answer,120he moves away from me, he cries121How do you know?122I say I heard about her123from stopover travelers.124He asks, he cries.125I say, yes, all126were blackhaired men.127From the closed room of the beach, alone,128I design your voice.129You talk and I dont hear a word130but only your voice,131the voice sleeping since a thousandyears.132From now on your voice is written133weakened by time134freed from history.135You would have run away136and I would have heard this name called in the city137Aurlia Steiner.138I would have kept track of the fall of the sound of those two words139until their disappearance.140As I heard the ascdening murmur of the sea141there would be no wind.142I still stand in this dark room facing the sea.143I have been alone in this house for years.144Everyones gone to join the quieter zones of the earth145because of the storms.146Here, terrible.147In the afternoon a slow dislocation occurred148between the green and black waters of the sea.149The huge puddle turned blue.150The movement has returned.151The sea quivered as if under the blows of a sudden wind.152Whereas there was no wind,153it was the evening that arrived.154And I opened the doors and windows to my room155and a soft light entered.156The horizon had become usual again,157Smooth and clear.158My mother, dead, put to sleep159under the lower flanks of the camp,160burnt deadwith the victims of gas chambers.161Aurlia Steiner, my mother.162My mother looks at the big white rectangle in front of her163of the assembly yard of the camp.164Her death agony is interminable.165Next to her side, the child is alive.166The whole sea has turned blue again167as always at this hour, you see?168It is a strong clarity 169just before the blushing of the night.170I cry, without sadness,171the evening that always falls on absence.172Here the great orange and golden beaches of heaven173above the sea.174Under the color it glitters, already discolored.175Here is the gold of the sky becoming milky176and then gray.177I cant do anything, I cant do anything178against the eternity that I bear179at the place of your last glance,180the one over the white rectangle of the camp assembly yard.181It was a summers day,182death was winning you over.183You still see, I believe,184but there isnt to be any more suffering,185insensitivity has already been reached.186You bathe in the blood of my essence.187I was next to you188within the dust of the soil. 189Around you, hard and cracked with the sun, this German land,190this foreign land, this light,191this perfect summer,192this warm sky.193In front of you, the white rectangle194where they died.195The storm arrived during the night.196A little after midnight, the wind.197And after that, she, the sea,198moved by the wind199she followed.200She has risen to storm the city, she climbed,201invaded, she broke, she shattered,202she burst through the walls, the doors, the windows,203she carried away roofs204and the city remains thus, open, under the wind.205I was listening to the cries of the sea.206Just before dawn, in the ghastly white,207the big salt silos burst.208The salt poured into the sea.209Its salinity has become fatal.210She passed from life to death in seconds.211The day has risen. Then, weighed down, poisoned,212the sea has calmed down.213In the white rectangle of the assembly yard214Aurlia Steiner still perceives215the hanged, soup thief,216who wriggle at the end of his rope,217????, very lightweight.218They cant hang on their own weight.219It is the morning of the second day.220My mother, eighteen years old, is dying.221In front of her, at the end of his rope, he calls out to her, 222he cries out for mad love.223She cant hear anymore.224This is the place in the world where Aurlia Steiner is.225She hears that the whole world is fighting the same fear.226She sees that the center of fear is shifting,227that it sinks around her, Aurlia Steiner.228She sees that the whole world feared her, Aurlia Steiner.229The next morning the city is still dripping,   230the sea recedes from the land, from the streets,231parks, cathedrals.232The boats of the port lay down on their sides.233The beaches are covered with dead fish.234In the sky, in the frozen sky235the sun is harsh, she is rotund.236The whole town falls asleep in this broad daylight237in the acuteness of the orange sky.238I go out into the sleepy city under the scary sun.239The sea is there, in bursts she cries again240and then she goes back to sleep.241A childs sleep 242haunted with nightmares.243The city is white with salt244that the sea left behind.245I walk.246Little by little, without me focusing on the future247you come back to me from exile,248from the night, from the other side of the world,249this tender darkness where you stand.250You go through the city.251I see you entering a hotel in the port.252Today you are a dark haired sailor,253tall.   254Always this leanness of youth or hunger.255You turned around, you hesitated256and then you walked away.257I know that when the night comes258you will go to this side of the street259and that you will look for her,260she, the one you met this morning in the city261and who caught your eye.262The reason for this feathery clothing, perhaps,263and that blue gaze under the black hair.264I went to lie down on the depths of the sea265facing the frozen sky.266She is still feverish, hot.267Little girl, dear.268Little child.269I called her by different names.270Aurlia from that of Aurlia Steiner.271In her depths she was still struggling272between exhaustion and the desire to kill.273Sometimes great movements lifted her up.274Love.275All of the things that speak for us.276You. Child. The sea.277I told him about the state of the city278and then I told him about the story.279He was under my back280A depth of, 10 meters? 281Or eight hundred meters.282Who knows? The difference did not exist.283The surface was pure illusion,284an open tear.285A silk of icy air.286I spoke to him for a long time.287I told him about the lovers in the white rectangle of death.288I sang.289I was talking to him and listening to the story.290I felt her under me291she, the sea, of the irrefutable strength of God.292When I got home, a newsagent293shouted the headlines of the wrath of the sea.294In my room, I rinsed my body and my hair with fresh water295and then I waited for the young sailor with black hair.296It is while waiting for him that I am writing to you.297It is with the trembling desire I have for him, that I love you. 298I bring them together through you299and with the bunch of them I make you.300You are he who will not be301but who thence is.302Out of everything, you appear303always unique304inexhaustible place of the world,305tireless love.306You are finally dead.307You had been untied of your rope, laid down308curled up on yourself 309in an untidy, sleepy, childish pose.310The white rectangle of the courtyard is empty,311except your body.312The lovers are dead.313You stole soup for the little girl, Aurlia.314You were discovered, you were hanged.315Above you, for three days,316the German sky.317Before your eyes this sky full of water and fruitful rain.318You called for three days 319at the end of your rope.320You screamed, repeated endlessly321that a child named Aurlia Steiner had just been born in the camp.322You asked that she be fed, that she is not be given to dogs,323you screamed, begged the world324that the little Aurlia Steiner is not forgotten.325Towards the evening of the third day326you were shot in the head327to put an end to this scandal.328She, she was dead in the morning.329At her side, the child.330The words Aurlia Steiner could not resonate in the camp,331they have been taken up elsewhere,332in other stages, in other areas of the world.333Towards evening here, there are always flashes of light on the horizon334even though the weather was overcast all day,335the same way if it rained.336The clouds for a moment move away337and let in sunlight.338In the evening again339I saw it again in that stroke of light on the sleeping sea.340I closed my eyes.341I just did it,342apparently I stopped writing to you.343So sometimes I see the color liquid and blue344empty eyes, already taken by death,345of the young hanged man, of the assembly yard.346I also see his youth.347He is eighteen too.348At that age he already reached his full size.349I dont know his name.350Its curious, you see?351I do not see the mother under the low flanks.352Nothing from her,353except the gesture of hiding the child.354The dark haired sailor is behind the window.355He looks at me.356He asks me where I am from.357I say I dont know.358He tells me he was on the beach.359He doesnt remember well360the woman he met in town this morning.361He says he met another person.362I ask him which one he desires.363He tells me the one he met in the morning. 364I tell him it was me.365I say to him I will give you a name.366You will pronounce it,367you wont understand why368and yet I ask you to do it,369to repeat it370without understanding why,371as if there was nothing to understand.372I tell him the name373Aurlia Steiner.374I write it down on a blank page and give it to him.375He deciphers slowly,376then he looks at me to see if he has read correctly.377I do not say anything.378I lie down next to him.379He repeats the name, he sees that I am listening to him.380He is clumsy at first381not knowing in which language to say it.382And then he throws the paper away, he comes back to me,383he talks to me with the name.384One would say he had all the time in the world.385He begins to discover the body of Aurlia Steiner.386She still doesnt look, her eyes closed387on the white rectangle of death.388Sometimes he says the whole name,389sometimes he only says the first name,390sometimes the last one.391He can no longer say any other name.392He says it in between kisses,393lips against the skin.394He says it in a low voice.395He shouts them.396He calls them inside the body,397against the mouth,398against the wall.399Sometimes he stands still.400As if he lost the memory of the names.401And then whispering, he says it again.402In a painful effort, 403as if the utterance itself was painful.404He says Jdin Jewess405Aurlia the Jewess.406Aurlia Steiner the Jewess.407He is standing still, entering Aurlia Steiners body408and he stays there,409always in the extreme care to carry out the torture to its end.410Then he enters the body.411In a very slow movement412in contrary to his overflow,413he enters the body of Aurlia Steiner.414Slowness makes lovers scream.415Again he says the name,416he repeats them in low tone again.417He said the names again.418He repeated it again,419but without voice, in a brutality that was marked420by an unknown accent.421I woke up at dawn.422The dark haired sailor was lying on my bedroom floor.423He was looking at me.424I heard him say his eyes burned him425for watching the beauty of Aurlia Steiner,426that his boat was leaving at noon,427but that he would not be on board,428that the boat would leave without him,429that he wished to stay with Aurlia Steiner,430whatever becomes of him.431I said I didnt belong to anyone in particular,432that I was not free of myself.433My name is Aurlia Steiner.434I live in Vancouver where my parents are teachers.435I am eighteen years old.

cancer.17And Christopher...18Hes in medical school now.19Can you believe it,my son the doctor.20You must realize how direthings are for me21To be on your doorstep.22I have little time left23And even less of the inheritancegarland left me.24It was all lostin the crash.25And when Im gone, Christopherwill have nowhere to go.26No means to finishhis schooling,27No other familyto support him.28I gave you my daughterby choice.29Tonight I am asking youto take my son.30iI had followedmy instinctsi31iBut that had led straightto mals death.i32Olivia, please.33iAnd so it began.i34iFor one dark year I pushed backagainst my instincts.i35This is Malcolms decisionto make.36iAnd learn to followMalcolms instead.i37Nothing will be freefor him here.38He will have to workfor his education.39But I dont needa tutor, daddy.40I just want to go back to schooland see my friends.41Sit.42iI became an observerin my own home.i43iNone of this goddamnpiano music!i44You know what I wantfor Christmas?!45Silence!46iI told myself that I did it for the safetyof my children.i47i...In here,day in and day out.i48Alicia has died.49iI thought that as longas I obeyed Malcolm...i50Where do you think Christopherwould like51This picture of his parents?52iOne thing couldremain certain.i53iThat what happened to mal wouldnever happen again in my home.i54Mother?55I thought perhapsI could ride my horse56Into town this afternoon.57If this is about your debutanteball dress,58I already have appointmentsset for seamstresses59To come to the housenext week.60Then shouldnt I know whatthe latest fashions are61Before they arrive?62You cant keep me locked upin this house forever.63Its up to your father.64Daddy...65With my debutante ballcoming up66I really need to have the bestdress, dont you think?67Well, only the bestfor my daughter68On the night she introducesherself to virginian society.69So, maybe you could give methe key to the swan room70And I could have a look throughgrandmothers old things71For some inspiration.72Why dont you visit the shopsin town instead?73I dont know, daddy.74It just doesnt sound very funto go all the way there75And look at all thosetantalizing things76And not have any means to bringany of them home.77Well, what is to be doneabout that, hmm?78I guess I could ask Joelto stop playing his piano79For a bit and take me.80Wouldnt that be a giftto us all.81Ive already lost my closestfriendships from school82Since no one writes anymore.83When they show up to my ball,if they even do,84Ill be a complete stranger.85How am I going to haveany fun?86Well, hopefully this Christopherfellow coming to stay87Will make father look up.88Its easy for you to seethe positives.89They actually let you leavefor school90And get away with a lifefull of secret dalliances91While Im stuck at home92Listening to the worldon the radio.93No, thats just becausesince mal died.94Well, fathers the only onemaking decisions these days95And he doesnt give a figwhat

had survival skills.29That counted for nothing.30Dont get on anybodys nerves.31Dont piss anybody off.32Strategy happens the momentwe got off that plane.33You dont need a leader.34And then again you dont wantto be too much of a weak link.35The leaders are the targets.36Heres what we plan on doing.37High tide is that line rightthere.38See that line?39Actually, before we build theshelter, just knock that whole40branch off.41Whats the first thing weneed to do?42Lets see what we got first,before we make any decisions.43Lets see what we got.44Are you guys all done talking?45I think were off to a badstart.46This is not a very good move.47This is not how to conductyourself on the first day after48a threehour swim ashore.49Yeah, after seeing Richard upa tree originally, I couldnt50imagine him surviving thisepisode.51Rich is just sitting in thetree, number one, trying to tell52everybody to talk.53Im looking up at the tree,like, What the hell are you54doing up there?55You should be down here talkingto us.56And whats the point?57Hes so separate, and hes upin the tree and acting so58condescending.59To me, the very wrong way to goabout it.60Im good to go, survivalwise.61Ive got the milliondollarcheck written already.62Its that kind of cocky attitudethat makes people really hate63your guts.64Richard really didnt knowwhat he was talking about.65Anybody could have won themillion at that point.66Richards doing what he onlyknows what to do sit on his ass67and talk.68Big mouth.69chucklesIn my head at the time, all I70thought when I was walking awayHes just a lazy fat ass.71Action, man.72Action, Richard.73You dont want to act ahead.74Richards a very smart man.75I dont think he was reallyconcerned if, at that point, if76people liked him or not.77He knew he had something tooffer.78He did play a masterful game,but there was also other factors79involved.80I feel as if luck played a rolein Richard winning.81I cant play armchairiSurvivori and say he did the82wrong thing, cause he ended upwinning.83You cant just go sit in a treenow.84If Richard was sitting in a treeoni Survivor II,i trust me, he85would have been made short orderof that day.86We need five more of these.87I didnt have any consciousstrategy, other than I knew when88I hit the island thatthat Iwanted to build a shelter.89What youll notice is thatthere are people that try and do90things on their own.91There will be people that willtry to be the goto guy.92Im gonna keep working.93B.B. builds buildings for aliving, and he built a great94building, but it was in thewrong location.95If youre a fisherman, thatsyour best asset.96Check that out.97If youre a chef or a cook,thats your best asset.98It is so good!99But you need to be good at itout there.100That way people want to keep youaround.101You tell me what youre doinghere, and Ill help you.102I promise you, Ill do it quick.103Thats the right way to doit, but we wont have near104enough line.105Anyway, dont stop now.106B.B. probably did work harderthan anybody else, uh...107but I think he was in too muchof a hurry.108Were okay, but none of theothers are down here helping109carry stuff.110I dont think he likes me

caught fish with571their spear.572And that does worry me alittle bit, because they are573going to be eating some protein.574We did a competition wherethey won a spear, so we knew575they had to be

from Africa...i877You dont have to be an evil,backstabbing person to do well878in this game.879PROBST What it took to win.880In the end, it was theprofessional soccer player and881coach from Lexington,Massachusetts, who was the sole882Survivor.883He won it with his strength, hissmarts, but mostly by sticking884to his principles.885Before he left for Africa, Isaid to him, Ethan, its not886that important that you comehome with 1 million, but you887know what you have to come homewith.888You have to come home with yourintegrity.889I said to myself, like,listen, Im not going to change890who I am as a person to be onthe show.891I want to come back with mydignity and selfrespect.892When I come home to Lexington,thats where I grew up, then I893usually make a grand entrance.894cheersThat kids got, you got my hair895back there.896laughterI like that.897Usually I go on and, you know,see my brother.898Hes a chiropractor.899Hi.900Doing okay?901So he gives me a littleadjustment to straighten me out902a bit.903I stop, I see my mom in herlittle knitting store.904Hi, Mommy.905Ethan!906I think hes appealing to women.907I mean, I cringe a little whenone of my

Come here.252Look at Gu Jingis eyes.253Hes looking at Lee Dohyungs chestinstead of his face.254His chest?255Is he looking at his fountain pen?256I think so.257He continues to look at the fountain pen,258then he takes it.Yes.259After that,260when Lee Dohyung tries to take it back,he stabs him in the neck.261The fountain pen.262Wait, maybe its that thing.A fountain pen camera.263Some reporters use it in secretwhile covering a case,264although they shouldnt.265He found the fountain pen camera266and stabbed him abruptly.267He mustve been stressed outright before his hearing.268But still, how can he kill a man?269He was once a respected doctor,270but he has hit the rock bottom.271Chairman Gu, from now on,272you must share everything with mewithout hiding anything.273Thats the only way I can keep you safe.274Did Nam Hyukchul kill Park Kitae275because of your order?276Youre right. It was my order.277Whats the reason?278I told him to bear false witnessin Geum Seokjus case279five years ago,280and he tried to share that in court.281Thats the only reason why you killed him?282By any chance, does this haveanything to do with taking out283someones heart five years ago,just as Assistant Director Lee said?284Thats nonsense.285I wouldnt do something that ridiculous.286Ill spend the rest of my life in prison287because of my charges of murderand murder instigation.288So you dont need to know anything else.289You didnt prepare a weapon beforehand.290You can find a way291to reduce your sentenceto involuntary manslaughter.292If Mr. Cheon cooperateswith the murder instigation,293youll find a way out of that too.294No.295Your job isnt to protect me.296Its to save Banseok.297ButMs. Pyo.298Ill take all flaws of Banseok299with me and go down.300So you must not focus on protecting me.301Focus on protecting my family and Banseok.302Protect them from Jayden and Honours Hand.303Give me an answer.304This is my final request.305Yes, sir.306How could he hide the bodyin the morgue of his hospital?307He probably hid him here to buy time308before he actuallytakes care of him later.309Did you find the fountain penhe used as a weapon?310No, I think Cheon Hyungu took it.311The police are looking for him,so hell be caught soon.312Wheres his guardian? Nobody is here yet?313I dont think anyone will come.314Hes separated from his wife,315and their children are still teenagers,so she cant show him to them.316Lets move him to the NFS for an autopsy.317iWhat?i318There was a hidden cameraon the fountain pen he used as a weapon?319Yes.320I think Lee Dohyung got caughttrying to record their conversation.321Thats why Gu Jingi322Why did Lee Dohyung do that?323Why did he take such a big risk324to film their conversation?325What if someone put him up for it?326Someone might have told himto film their conversation327for something irresistibleso that Lee Dohyung will risk himself.328Ill get going.329I only have less than a dayto hold Yoon Miseon under custody.330Right. If she got a heart transplant,331shell need a daily doseof immunodepressants and antibiotics.332So find out the drugs she tookbetween yesterday and today.333Okay, Ill check.334iWhat if someone put him up for it?i335iSomeone might have told himto film their conversationi336ifor something irresistibleso that Lee Dohyung will risk himself.i337YOON MISEON338Its my resignation letter.339Please process it anytime.340Sure.341A prosecutor confessed to usingcoercive measures before the public.342Of course, you should resign.343I am sorry.344You punk, why did you do that?345I have known you for years.346I know you arent like that.347You dont receive bribesor special treatments.348What was the reason?349I dont know.350I must have been insane back then.351For goodness sake.

Is your pulse rising?28Those who have sufferedfrom heart diseases for a long time29have a habitof frequently checking their pulse.30Since they can havean irregular heartbeat at any time,31theyre always anxious.32Lets say I got a heart transplant.33Then is there evidence that shows34I got Geum Seokjus heart?35Michael told me36when you were in Korea five years agoto invest in Banseok Foundation,37you were in a car accidentand received emergency surgery.38On November 21st, 2016.39The night I performeda heart transplant on the VIP patient40at Banseokwon.41I looked into every single patientwho had surgeries that day at Banseokwon.42But43I couldnt find any car accident victims.Then theres only one answer.44The patient was operated onby me, a ghost doctor.45So there was no record of this patient.46The patient was you, Jayden.47If you want to ask for forgiveness,this is the only chance you have.48Forgiveness?Yes.49If theres an ounce of remorse50for the owner of the heartthats beating inside your chest,51you should askProsecutor Geums forgiveness.52And reveal the truth in court.53See?54Youre still so arrogant.55Im about to be your enemy, but you aregiving me a chance to be forgiven?56Sorry to break it to you,57but I dont want any forgiveness.58If you think I took Geum Seokjus heart,59find the evidence60and make me stand trial.61Okay.62Thats what Ill do then.63If you had a conscience,64you wouldnt have mocked usby pretending to be clueless65or helping us find my brothers heartwhen you knew all along66that we were looking for you.67Unless you have a warrant,68please leave.69Ive got nothing more to say to you.70iYou think Jayden receivedan illegallyharvested organ?i71EPISODE 1572I havent found out yetwhat happened in detail.73But thats whatMr. Han and Prosecutor Geum believe.74iIf thats what really happened,i75its a chance for us76ito turn the table around in one go.iI see.77IM DONE, LETS MEET NOW78Ill look into this more.79The accusation Han Yihan made.80Is it true?If its true,81will you criticize me too?82No. I can understand that.83People do anything to survive.84And the heart you got happened to belongto Prosecutor Geums brother.85You and that prosecutor were both unlucky.86Unlucky?87Are you all right?You took the drugs a while ago.88Im fine. It was just a health supplementthat only looked like the drugs.89What?90Why would you pull a prank on me?91I wanted to checkif you were going to take it.92Too bad.93If Gu Hyunseong didnt show up,94I wonder if you would have takenthe drugs I gave you.95Those despicable cheaters.96How dare they fool me?97To be honest,I felt guilty about what I did to you.98But after seeing everything,I think I made the right decision.99If Jayden didnt steal you from me,100I wouldnt have done this.101Steal me?102Youre still talking like that.103Am I an object?Something people can steal or lose?104Dont fool yourself.105I had never loved youor considered you romantically106even for a moment.107So Jayden didnt steal me from you108because you never had me, to begin with.109Now that you know everything,I dont want to see you ever again.110I must figure it out.111What112What I can do now.113You want me to tell you everything I know?114Then you two must help me115and Susie Yoon with our plan.116Well decide after you tell us everything.117Explain the relationshipbetween Jayden and Gu Jingi in detail.118Start from when Honours Hand plannedto invest in Banseok five years ago.119To be honest, Honours Hand120was skeptical about investingin Banseok Foundation.121Forget about privatizingthe health care sector in Korea.122Setting upa forprofit hospital is difficult.123So investing a hefty sumof 300 billion won in a medical foundation124was just too risky.125Jayden pushed for it.126He said he would negotiate with Gu Jingi.127Nice to meet you. Im Gu Jingi.Nice to meet you.128Shes from our legal team.This is Ms. Pyo Eunsil.129Compared to our investmentwhich is 300 billion won,130your collateral isnt much.131On top of that, you will pay backhalf of our investment with the stocks132of the R and D Center you just founded.133We cannot agree to these terms.134The biorelated businesses in Koreawill grow drastically in several years.135And the stocks of the R and D Centerwill skyrocket beyond measure.136And as for the collateralWe should137discuss that in private.138iI did get the feelingthat Jayden and Gu Jingii139might have worked out a dealunder the table.140They often had private meetingswithout me and Ms. Pyo141with just the two of them.142And three days before the accident,143Jayden said he would stay at Banseokwon.144And when I rushed over after hearingthe news about his car accident,145he was lying in the VIP room, unconscious.146NEWHOPE LAW OFFICE147You should lookinto Jaydens car accident.148To undergo heart transplant surgery,149patients must be prepped for two days.150But if he left Banseokwon beforethe surgery and got into an accident,151there must be a reason for it.152Okay. Ill ask the policeto cooperate and look into this.153We should do everything we can.154Ill get going.155Whats wrong?

Thank you.358Dont mention it.359At first, I doubted it.360So that I could gettransplantation that day,361you caused the accident.362A doctor is someone who saves lives,so I never imagined363such a thing.364So I ran various investigationsafter I got discharged.365The boy who receivedthe heart transplantation on the same day366died the next day.367The doctor who operated on him368got arrested by the prosecution369and had his medical license revoked.370You are saying I induced a heart attackso that you would get into an accident.371Had you died in the process,372the investment would have been off.373Why would I do such a thing?374Thats right. The grounds are weak.375So I invested in Banseokand watched for years.376But the doctorwho had operated on the boy that day377became a lawyerwho specializes in medical lawsuits378and pointed his knife at you and Banseok.379It piqued my interest,so I approached him.380There were many secrets I didnt know.381The medical malpractice five years ago.382Give me 200 joules.He just383Give me 200 joules!

It is unfortunate.706But at that moment,707the defendant was consumedwith the realization708that his colleague had betrayed him.709He also had a hearing an hour later.710In this situation,711how many people could calmly give orders712for medical assistance?713Could you do that, Prosecutor?714Shes deviatingfrom the essence of the case.715Please rephrase this.716Sustained.717Counsel, please give your argumentbased on the facts.718I will practice caution.719Then from this point forward,I will speak about the truth.720Is the person who murdered the victim721really the defendant sitting here?722The victim didnt die723on the spot in the parking lot.724The person who ended his life725was this man,Chief Secretary Cheon Hyungu.726Mr. Cheon.

But I was in a dilemma.15I did not know if I should replyas your young master or pupil.16Or just reply based on what I read.17What did you read?18Then should I also replybased on what I read?19Also? What do you mean?20It is written here.21I will go this far just to see you.22I can do anythingif it means being able to see you.23And this is my reply.24I also missed you.25That is my reply.26I will pretend like I did not hear that.27You should forget about the letter too.28You cannot get rid of something29that has already been exchanged.30It is as good as gone.31Once it burns away,32there will be nothing left.33So you think burning itwill make it disappear?34But know this, Master.35Your pupil36has recently learned to readwhat cannot be seen.37I told you that I read Words of the Heart.Do you want to check?38You must focus39when you are trying to readwhat you cannot see.40And then41call out the name of the receiver.42Mudeok.43This is a clear and dangerous signal.44I am in love with this man.45There. I read you.46Some things are hard to seebecause they are hidden,47not because they do not exist.48Just as you saw my blue markand found out I was a soul shifter,49you have once again caught me.50You have found another weakness of mine.51If you must call that a weakness,52then it is my weakness too.53You sent me a letter,and I sent you a reply.54So we both share that weakness.55I guess I would not mindhaving you share a weakness.56Honestly, I felt anxiouswhile we were apart.57You finally had what you always wanted,58and I had no power to do anythingeven if you chose to betray me.59I even thought to myself thatI should have poisoned you60and found something to blackmail you with.61But Uk,62it seems you havealready poisoned yourself.63Poison?64You will become weak and miserable.65It is a terrible poison you cannot escape,66as its only antidote isthe person it is from.67Are you sayingthe reason I missed you so much68was that I was poisoned?69Yes.70You were cruelly poisonedby a dangerous assassin.71Think of it as that.72And it is not far from the truth.73So I was poisoned?74Then again, I did find it bizarrethat the person I missed75was you of all people.76You always threaten to kill me.77You even once threw a knife at me.78You mocked my incompetenceand even made my arm rot.79Yet you had the audacity to lie.80You were always so horrible to me,81but I could not get you out of my head.82I miss you first thing in the morning,83all throughout the day,and even when I lie down to go to sleep.84Stop.Why should I stop?85I confessed my feelings,and you ruined it with poison.86So you should at least know my symptoms.87You said you were my antidote.88All I did was sincerely tell youthat I missed you, you wicked assassin.89You called it poison.90So from now on,I will complain to you about my symptoms.91After all, I was poisoned.92I have nothing to be embarrassed about.93You called yourself an antidote,so you deal with this toxin.94This young master isthe nephew of Songrims leader95and the future leader of our organization.96I have come to greet youon behalf of the leader.97Congratulations onbecoming a Songrim member.98Welcome.99You all did a great job today.100Tonight, you will be serveda generous amount of alcohol and meat.101So relax and have fun.102Go get yourselves a drink.103Follow me.Yes, sir.104Young Master.105Are you acquainted with Mudeok,106the servant who passed the exam today?107I am talking about the maidwho came in last.108ONE HUNDRED TWENTYFIVE109SONGRIM SERVANT CONTEST110Number 125, Mudeok.111You have passed!112Yes, I am very wellacquaintedwith Mudeok.113She fainted due to exhaustionand got taken to Sejukwon.114I need to returnthe bag she brought to the contest115along with this entrance plaque.116Is she still at Sejukwon?117Give it to me. I will give it to her.118You did great today.119All right. Let us go.120Mudeok.121The reason you get lostwhen you have a lot on your mind122is that you are focusedon too many things.123When that happens,just try to focus on one thing.124So the only one in your mindhas been Jang Uk, Naksu.125Hey, Yul.126I happened to look inside Mudeoks bag,127and I found something strange in here.128Is this not the whistleyou used to carry around?129The one you left at Danhyanggok.130Yes, that is mine.131Then why does Mudeok have it?132Have you seen Young Master Park?133He apparently has my bagand entrance plaque.134He gave them to me.135I see.136I will take that.137I left this at Danhyanggok.Is that where you got this?138Yes.139I kept it because140Because you are in love with me.141You told me that you were in love with me.142That is enough of an explanation.143I will just take my things.144You can keep the whistle.145I already told Dangguthat I gave it to you.146So I cannot take it back.147Why are you giving this to me?148You did not believe mewhen I said I was in love with you.149Then do a better joband make me believe it.150Up until now, I was just teasing them.151But Mudeok is actually in love with Yul.152And seeing how Yul gave her that,153I am guessinghe has some feelings as well.154She probably asked him for the whistle.155When she needs something,156she easily flatters people and lies.157Yul even knew about Mudeoks test.158He solved all the test questions for her.159She probably asked Yulto help her out beforehand160because she was so desperate to pass.161She always gets what she wants.162Most importantly,163I saw themaffectionately spending time together.164What?165Affectionately?166Mudeok and Yul met upwith each other separately.167I guess you did not know because you werelocked up in the Training Center.168Gosh.169No, I had no idea.170What if it is true?171I also missed you.172That is my reply.173She turned me downbecause she did not like me.174She did not miss me like I did.175I was the only one who felt that way.176I177I should just poison myself and die.178This is so embarrassing.179I am indeed in love with you.180I can tell you thathundreds and thousands of times.181I do not know much about love,182but when you truly love someone,you will not need to say it that often.183Because it will be hardjust to say it once.184That whistle used to belong185to a friend I once failedto confess my feelings for.186I liked you a lot.187I have always wanted to tell her that.188I would also like to try.189Can I have that?190We will be seeing each other oftennow that you are back in Songrim.191You may come to me if you need any help.192Thank you.193Uk managed to read Words of the Heart.194Master, you helped him, did you not?195I figured you might want to know,so I came to inform you.196Tell Jin to take that bookand hand it over to Jinyowon.197There is a bone here.198Why?199Uk got angry at the fact thateveryone was reading it.200I think Master Seo Gyeongwould have felt the same way.201It seems like you are very fond of Uk.202He is a special young man,so I have my eyes on him.203He is a clever fellow,204but Jin just wants to keep him locked up.205Are you sure206the ice stone is not somewhere in Songrim?207What makes you think that?208Twenty years ago,209Gwanju Jang Gangperformed the alchemy of souls.210Because of that,211a child thatshould not have been born was born.212And that night,the Kings Star was in the night sky.213Is that child Jang Uk?214Yes.215A mage at Songrim unsealed the ice stone216and birthed the kings sonthrough the alchemy of souls.217And Jin Mu at Cheonbugwan knows this fact.218If the ice stone hasalready fallen into their hands,219what kind of justificationcan Songrim use220to take that stone from them?221Jin has no choice but to hide Ukbecause he wishes to protect Songrim.222Why?223Is there something I do not know about?224You little225How am I supposed to say anythingto such a careless and imprudent punk?226How could you227I hope I can wash this off.228He229He is angrier than he waswhen I told him I decided230to stop training with chaste herbs.231Wait. He got that scarffrom Maidservant Kim.232I am sorry.233We must finish cleaning234before the mages begin their day,so move quickly.235Yes, maam.Yes, maam.236Where is Young Master Jang?237Is he not here?Well238I went to wake him up,239but he told mehe did not sleep a wink last night.240So he did not wake up?

Tell him you will do it.267Listen. I am a bit tired.268You can ask Master Leehow to read Words of the Heart.269Uk.270I mastered Ryusuaround the same time you did.271So what do you say we fight a duel?272Then I will lend youa precious sapphire mat273that I use for training.274If you train with that,it will double your energy.275A sapphire mat?That is very hard to come by.276Young Master, this is great.277But sapphire mats are really cold,are they not?278I easily get cold these days.279So I do not need something like that.280What are you doing?281I have not been sleeping well these days,so I am going to take a nap.282You missed your chanceto learn the Hyeongong Technique.283Are you mad?284The same goes for yesterday.Sapphire mats are so rare,285but you refused, saying it was cold.286You should have said yeseven if you were to die on that mat.287You are unbelievable.You are mad. Just die.288That is all you ever say to me.289Just give me that.290What are you doing?291There is no space to nap together.292You must get through me to take a nap.293Move.294Make me.295It will not take too much effort.296Damn it.297I told you I missed you,298but you told me I was poisoned.I need to sleep to recover from the shock,299so stop pushing meand stay away for a bit.300You just want to make me feel frustrated.301Like I said, if I die, you die.302I am in agony,so you should at least feel irritated.303I even have convulsionswhen I sleep these days.304For how long, then?305I do not know.306Why? Does it frustrate you?307That will help me sleep well.308Young Master Jang will not stop sleeping.309You should beat him up and make him train.310The mages of Jeongjingak trainon their own accord.311How fast one masters ones energyall depends on the individual.312I will not interfereas long as he sticks to the rules.313But314Do not worry. There he is.315Hello.316My head hurts so much.317I would like to go home318and recuperate by taking a bath.319Why does your heart hurt?You have not done a thing.320You cannot go home on your own accord.That is against the rules.321Is it not?322Uk is an exception.The leader gave him permission.323Why only him?324You may have been too busyhaving fun to know about this,325but I made a deal with the leaderwhile I was locked in here.326I will be back.327I will go with him.328If you go, you will be fired.329You went through a lot to get hired.Are you okay with getting fired?330Damn it.331Jang Uk went home.332Are you sure that is okay?333Let him do whatever he wants334so he can remain lazy.335My lord.336Lady Jin is asking youto wait a little longer.337Is she with another guest?338I saw a servant from Cheonbugwanon our way inside.339By any chance, do you thinkAssistant Gwanju Jin Mu is here?340They are not close enoughto personally meet up like this.341Just in case, go see if anyone leaves.342If that is what Master Lee wants,343we will store Words of the Heartsafely in Jinyowon.344Were you meeting someone else before me?345A distant relative.346Is Young Lady Jin going to bethe official heir of Jinyowon?347That has not been decided yet.348My eldest daughter might still be alive.349It has been ten years since the accident.350Although she could not see,351she could feel energyand could control relics like no other.352She was a very clever girl.353Unlike other babies,354it took her 13 monthsto come out into this world.355She was born on the very daythat Gwanju Jang Gang picked356as a blessed day from the skies.357She was born exactly on the daythat Jang Gang picked for you?358Is it possible359to choose the date and timeof a babys birth?360It just happened to match.361I would like to invite Master Leeto Jinyowon someday.362Please tell him that.363I will.364I had her inside me for 13 months.365I cannot let her go like this.366I heard the ice stone has the power367to bring back the souls of the dead.368Gwanju.369Please help me.370I went far and beyond to protect my baby.371I will find you.372I will do everything I can373to find you.374Did you check who the previous guest was?Yes.375It was Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu.376Since when did the leader of Jinyowon377acknowledge him as a family memberand meet with him like this?378He quietly left through the back gate.379They must have made a secret deal.380I wonder what that cunning man, Jin Mu,381is using as baitto freely enter Jinyowon like this.382There is no way to find out where you aresince you cannot see.383If you do as you are toldand stay completely silent,384your life will be spared.385Do not make any noise.386Stand up.387Sit down.388Leave that one here. The others can go.389They are looking for the girlin the portrait.390She must be blind.391He just said the others could leave,but why is there no movement?392You can see.393What a pity.I thought I had found an adequate girl.394Kill her.395I can do it!396I can be the girl in the portrait.397Please have mercy.398You said I was adequate.399If you need me to be blind400then blind I will be.401You are a very daring girl. Stand up.402So you can act like you are blind?403I already am blind.404Let me see if that is true.405It really looks likeI have found an adequate girl.406You will do.407From now on, you are Jin Buyeon,the missing daughter of Jinyowon.408Yes.409I am Jin Buyeon.410Uk has stopped once again.411What kind of cliffdo I have to push him off of this time?412I see you are working hard thanks to me.413Yes.414Thanks to you,I will have to sweep the yard again.415Are you complaining?416Then I will have you gone.417You cheated your way in here.418If I say a word about this,you will be fired.419Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.420I am grateful for the leavesyou have sprinkled for me to sweep.421You may keep going your way,Your Royal Highness.422You should be grateful423for the answer sheet I gave you,not these leaves.424I see you were not being grouchy.You just wanted to receive credit.425Goodness, I was too slow to notice that.426I am grateful, Your Royal Highness.427Of course, you are grateful.I solved those questions myself.428Do you even knowhow to wash off ink stains?429You solved that question,Your Royal Highness?430Yes, that is right. I am the Crown Prince.431Yet I learned that rice pastegets rid of ink stains.432I even tried it myself,and it actually worked.433Unbelievable.434I am forever indebted to you.435So tell me.436Are you happy to be with your master?437I heard Uk read Words of the Heart.438Yes.439He was the fastest magein Jeongjingak to have read it.440I doubt he read it with his skills.441He probably got lucky again.442But still, he beat you in a duel.443Goodness.444I know Uks level of capacity very wellsince I have fought against him.445He has bad swordsmanship,and his spells are weak.446He got lucky and beat me by using Tansu.It was not because he was skilled.447He is accurate.448That is why he came to Jeongjingak.To become a mage of a higher level.449To be frank, he does not even havewhat it takes to enter Jeongjingak.450If he manages to beat anyone here,451then I shall acknowledge him.452Using the Crown Princewould not be such a bad idea.453Your Royal Highness.454Then how about we make a bet?455A bet?456What will I gainfrom making a bet with you?457I will bet the most precious thing I own.458I will choose first.459I pick red. You can have the blue one.460Wait there. I will go to you soon.461I also missed you.462That is my reply.463Young Master.Hey.464I brought honey biscuits, your favorite.465Are you also staying for dinner?466No, I am staying here for a few days.467Is that allowed?The leader gave me his permission.468He let me be an exception for everything.469Well, I get why.470It only took you a few daysto read Words of the Heart.471It is absurd to make you abideby the same rules as ordinary mages.472Are you happy about my achievements?473I am more than happy.474You have no idea how proud I am.475Maidservant Kim.476I know I have always disappointed you,but you can feel proud now.477Should I get you a nice dressto help you boast?478My goodness.479I do not wish for anything anymore.I already feel like I have everything.480These days, people come up to me481and tell me thatyou truly are your fathers son.482They do?483Your father used to be called a genius,484and they say you areas talented as your father.485People used to say I was nothing like him.486As you continue to achieve things,487there will be fewer peoplewho say that about you.488What if I do not do well?Will they say I am not his son again?489No, that is not490Tell them to go aheadand say what they want about me.491I do not care anymore.492Yes, we should notlet that bother us anymore.493Frankly speaking, you are responsiblefor your own achievements.494Your father is irrelevant.495He was never around for you anyway.496And to be honest, it is all because497I raised you well.498You will always bemy precious young master499no matter how competentor incompetent you are.500Really?501Then can I go backto slacking off like I used to?502Yes, if that is what you want.503But I thought you hated that.504Compared to the timeswhen you used to slack off at home,505you looked a lot happierwhen you had just come back506from your training in Danhyanggok.507That is why I could not stop youeven though it seemed dangerous.508You see,509I want you to achieveeverything you want to achieve.510All right.511I should go back.512You are leaving?513Yes. If you forced me to leave,then I would have refused to go.514But after that speech,I should go and study.515I should do everything I canto make you proud, Maidservant Kim.516How is your headache? Is it better?517Yes.518Horses and people are trained519through the carrotandstick approach.520But recently,I kept getting hit by a stick.521Who in the world dared to hit you?522Do not worry. I am not oneto stay still after getting beaten.523Just pack me some snacks.524A ton of honey biscuits.525This is going to be fun.Are you sure?526Hey, Uk.527You are finally here.528Yes.529Why does it seem likeyou have all been waiting for me?530Are you fans of the honey biscuitsI bring from home?531You should go to the Training Center.It will be fun.532You have been waiting for me?Yes.533I will be your first opponent.534What?535Let us fight a duel.536If you refuse, you lose.537What are you talking about?538Just take it.539Uk has lost.540Gu Hyo, the winner,may take the first gold toad.541What is going on?542I have made a bet.543I never made a bet with you,Your Royal Highness.544Not with you. I have made a betwith your maid, Mudeok.545I told her that you did nothave the skills to beat any of the mages546here at Jeongjingak.547But your maid insisted thatyou could at least beat one.548Mudeok said that, did she?549You will fight a duel every dayfor ten days.550If you fail to beat a single fight,551she will give me an itemthat is most valuable to her.552Valuable?553What valuable item do you have?554It is something you gave me.555This is what she bet.556This jade looks very valuable,so I want it for myself.557So I brought gold toads558as prizes for the match.559If you fail to beat a single opponentbefore all those toads disappear,560this will be mine.561I am not interestedin taking part in this bet.562This is not a bet between us.It is a bet I made with her.563If you give up,564you will not have won a single match,so she will lose.565And this will be mine.566Young Master Jang.567That is the most precious objectI have ever received.568Please do your bestso you can win it back.569Look at that.570You really won this gold toad.571Of course. Uk may have managedto read Words of the Heart,572but he is a bad swordsman.What is going on?573The Crown Prince and Mudeokmade a bet over Uk.574The Crown Prince brought gold toads,so everyone is eager to participate.575The strongest magesare lining up to fight Uk.576Put it down.577The Crown Prince mocked your competence.578As your master, I could not let it slide.579Do not lie to me. I know you.580I have been lazy these past few days,581so you made that senseless betto force me to train.582Yes, I did.583You will have to fight ten magesregardless of your will.584The first duel wasincredibly disappointing.585Your sword was slow,and your feet were heavy.586Tomorrows opponent is from the JungI am not doing it.587Even if you lose,you always memorize what you see,588so it will help you learn.589I told you I am not fighting.As you fight ten mages,590you will learn ten different spells.591MudeokYoung Master.592Feel free to go homefor a bath again tomorrow.593Then you will never get that jade back.594All right, fine.595So you made this bet.596But597But how could you bet on that?598You know why.599That was the only thingto motivate you to fight hard and win.600When I said I missed you,601is this what you meantwhen you said you had my weakness?602Yes.603You probably despise me right now,604but you cannot losewhat we share to someone else.605So this is why you said I was poisoned.606If you get it back,I will give you a bright smile.607Just like an antidote.608Uk.609Return it to me no matter what.610It is the most precious itemI have ever received611in my entire life.612Is it really precious to you?613Do you not want it back614merely because of its price?615I will get it back from the Crown Prince.616It would be funny to sharethat jade with him.617But it was not worthsharing it with you either.618I heard you have beenvisiting Sejukwon pretty often.619Is it because you wishto appoint Master Heo as your master620and learn spells from him?621Do not be ridiculous.622You are my master.623I am only going there for treatment.624It allows me to get some fresh air.Not to mention, fun things happen there.625You must enjoy hanging outwith the mages of Songrim.626I get to meet Yul, my cousin.627Park Danggu isa lively person to be around.628As for Jang Uk, I would liketo teach him a lesson, but it is not easy.629He seemed elatedafter having read Words of the Heart,630so I put him back in his place today.631He lost to a mage who just mastered Ryusu.632So people know his true competence now.633People no longer admire him.634That is a nice jade.635I got it in exchange for ten gold toads.636Is it something valuable?That blue jade holds yin energy.637Where is the other one?638The other one?639Items with opposite energiescome in pairs.640There should be a red jadethat goes with it.641They are only valuablewhen they are together.642So this is supposed to be a pair?643Eunuch Oh.644What does it mean when two peopleshare something that should be a pair?645It means they are married or a couple.646Damn it.647Do you not like the jade,Your Royal Highness?648I do not like it. It gets on my nerves.It extremely bothers me.649Take it away and smash it to pieces.650You cannot do that yet.651Jang Uk might win it back.652If he takes it back,653they will become a pair again.654Damn it.655Master Lee.Yes656What brings you here?657I wore hemp fabric all year round,yet I never felt cold.658But659after I wore this scarf,660I realized how cold it had been.661What is that over there?662What663My goodness.664I never once thought flowers were pretty,665but I saw these flowersand wanted to show them to you.666How pretty.667Are they for me?668These books669You have nice books here.670What a great read.671About Maidservant Kim672Is she sick?673I have not seen her at Songrim these days.674She went there yesterday.675She goes there oftento meet Young Master Jang.676I see.677She just did not drop by to see me.678She is with a guest right now.679A guest? Who is it?680I do not know who he is,but he was a young man.681A young man?682From what I know, Maidservant Kimis not acquainted with any young men.683Maidservant Kim.684Hello.685What are those weeds?686They are flowers.687How could you call them weeds?Maidservant Kim.688Did you get upset that daybecause I was a bit harsh?689Is that why you stopped visiting?690I really had no idea.I thought you were sick.691I came here worried for nothing.692You should not have come.693You said you would never visit again.694When did I ever say that?695You are mistaken.696But still,697I am glad that you are all right.698If you were worried that I might be sick,699you could have brought mea bundle of weeds like this one.700Do you need weeds?701I will get them for you.702I do not need them.703What I want from you are flowers,not weeds.704I want you to show me705how much you care706by giving me something beautiful.707We still have a guest here,so you should go.708Maidservant Kim.709Well710Next time you come to Songrim to visit Uk,711I hope you will drop by and visit me too.712Wait713Is she kicking me out714because I came emptyhanded?715Maidservant Kim.716What a coldhearted woman.717Seeing that his shoesare smaller than mine,718he must be shorter than I am.719Do you like sweet snacks?720Yes, I do.721It is delicious.722Then here is one more723For me.724How do I look?You look pretty.725Try this.Me?726How do I look?727It should go there.I see.728Look. There is a flower shop over there.729You said you needed to buy flowers.730I need to buy flowersto decorate Buyeons room.731We might really find her this time.732Really? Will Jin Mu find her?733It is still a secret.734I really hope Buyeon comes back.735Then you will not be able to becomethe leader of Jinyowon.736Instead, I will be freeto marry the man I want to marry.737I will be allowed to marry the man I love.738That is good news.739Then we should hurry upand end our fake engagement.740Thank you for pretendingto be my fake betrothed.741I never pretended.742My feelings743were sincere.744But you are an heir to Songrim.745How could you think of marrying meand moving in with my family?746I know.747I guess I was worried for nothing.748I was even getting ready749to get kicked out of the family.750Are you serious?751You were willing to give up onbecoming Songrims heir because of me?752You said you did not wanta loveless marriage.753I figured if I married you,754you would at least marrya man that loved you.755That is why.756Anyway, you should meet a manthat you have feelings for.757I feel like I have758already met him.759If you hold onto me like this760I will never give up on you.761My feelings for you are too strong.762There is no turning back.763I should get you flowersto properly propose to you.764Let us go.765Send these flowers to the Jang family.766Did someone die in the family?767Why are you sending themwhite chrysanthemums?768I almost made a huge mistake.769Right.770Everything from here771to all the way over there.772Send them all.773All these flowers?Yes, send them all.774I am sure she will like at least one.Goodness.775My goodness, thank you so much.776Which one would you like?This one.777I can get you everything if you want.778You are the heir of Songrim.779Why would you courtthe future leader of Jinyowon?780What was your plan?781Did you plan to give up your successionand marry into their family?782Uncle, we are in love with each other.783Up until recently, Young Lady Jin784had feelings for Uk.785That is wrong. She proved it to me today.786Young Lady Jin said she could give upbecoming the leader of Jinyowon for love.787They only have one daughter.788Who will lead Jinyowon then?789That position is supposed to goto the eldest daughter.790They are receiving help from Cheonbugwanto help find her missing sister.791What?792Assistant Gwanju Jin Muvisits them every day for that.793Jin Mu?794I too wish I had another brother795who could take over for meand become Songrims heir instead.796This is just a question out of curiosity.797Uncle, is there no chancethat you might have a secret child?798No one?799Not once?800Get out.801I said, get out.802Pardon?803Get out!804It is not too late to have a child now.805Hey.806I mean you are still healthy.807Catch that punk!808Oh, dear.809Why are there so many flowers here?810I tried to cut ties with someone,and this is how he tries to make up.811I hope you forgive him.The flowers are so pretty.812You speak such kind words.813Young Master Jangs mother814was also kind just like you.815Young Master Jang is kind too.816He is?817What makes you think he is kind?818When he talked about his mother,819I could feel the warmth820in his eyes.821What?822He spoke to you about his mother?823You two must be very close.824No, not yet.825He is the one who wishes to become close.826Last time,he kept her busy for four hours.827Is that true?828We just had a chat.829So it really is you. The egret.830Young Master Jang can be bluntdue to his past scars.831But after he opens up to someone,he is very kind and warm.832I hope you visit often.833Think of this place as your nest.834Feel free to fly in here and visit often.835I will.836Jin Mu is helping Jin Hogyeongfind her missing daughter?837It looks like he isusing that as an excuse838to frequently visit Jinyowon.839I guess Jin Mu wants Jinyowon on his side.840If Jin Mu gets his hands on Jinyowon,841he will become powerful enoughto fight against Songrim.842And843if he no longer fears Songrim,844he and his men will reveal the ice stoneand show it to the world.845Someone on Jin Mus sideis in possession of the ice stone.846The ice stone may seem likeit is made of ice,847but it also has the nature of fire,water, and wind.848Just as a Choi family magedid 200 years ago,849somebody is using the ice stones powerto make the Soul Ejector.850This is the new batch of Soul Ejectorsmade by the Queen.851It is not the power of the ice stonethat is evil.852It is the Soul Ejectorthat is being used for evil deeds.853The kind of powerthat is not granted to humans854but would be coveted by anyoneif available.855The power to leave the bodyyou no longer wish to live in856and move to a new one.857From an old body to a new one,an ugly body to a beautiful one.858The power to stop deathand live for eternity.859He is a young, healthy,and beautiful young man.860He has861already been selected to be my successor.862This is where I would like to move into.863Master.864What is the new spellyou promised to show me?865It is the alchemy of souls.866The alchemy of souls?867I still have many more things to achieve.868But this body is oldand facing death due to sickness.869Which is why870I need your body.871What?872Let us begin the alchemy of souls.873Master, I do not wish to switch bodies.874If I enter your body, I will die soon.875But your body will still be alive.876Please help me.877Help me live.878Help! Help me!879Master!880Master.881My body882Give me back my body.883Please. I do not wish to die.884Master! Give me back my body!885Master! I want my body back!886Master!887Once again, the soul ofanother valuable mage has been saved888by the alchemy of souls.889As long as890we possess the power of the ice stone,891our souls will be able to live foreverinstead of dying in this body.892The great power of the ice stoneis currently classified as sorcery,893which is why we have no choicebut to lie low like this.894But sooner or later, there will come a daywhen our power grows strong enough for us895to show everyone that we were rightand that what we wish for is inevitable.896When that day comes,897everyone here898will overcome deathand be given eternal life.899Did you witness everything?900Yes.901Your job will be to bring someone here.902Jin Hogyeong is going to be your mother,and I want you to win over her heart.903Then bring her to this place.904Can you do that?905Yes.906You found an adequate match.907If we manage to bring Jin Hogyeong here,908it will become easier for usto reveal the ice stone to the world.909My love, why are you still up?910Jin Mus power and influence911might be strongerand more widespread than we think.912The Kings Star must have appeared to dealwith the chaos brought by the ice stone.913Are you talking about Uk?914Master Seo Gyeong, who stopped the chaosbrought by the ice stone 200 years ago,915was also born with the energyof the Kings Star.916That Kings Starwas created through sorcery.917You cannot compare thatto Master Seo Gyeong.918They are different.I did not say they were the same.919That is why I am curious.920I am curious to see if this new starwill slowly fade away921or start shining brightly.922Win!923Nice.Great job.924I knew you would win.925I know you use Tansu.926The Crown Prince was unaware,which is why it worked.927But you used Tansu with waterfrom a puddle everyone can see.928It was not hard to block.929Win!930You did great!Amazing!931There are only three toads left?932Yes, Your Royal Highness.933Does that mean he has beenfighting nonstop for the past seven days?934It means he continuously lost.935I thought he would stop if he kept losing.936But I guesshe will keep fighting for this.937You were right, Your Royal Highness.His swordsmanship and spells are weak.938But he keeps fighting939only because he is persistent.940I know it is just a duel, but he has beenfighting Jeongjingak mages every day.941So I bet he is exhausted.942I am sure you will win,Your Royal Highness.943Even I did not get a chanceto fight with Jeongjingak mages.944But I am letting Jang Uk do that945at the expense of my own gold toads.946Did I get fooled by Filthy Mudeok?947Fight and perish, Jang Uk.948All the pain that does not kill you949will only make you stronger.950Uk!You must be here for your young master.951Uk may be losing, but he is improving.952Do not go.953Do not go to your room and just stay here.954Goodness, look at your shoes.They are drenched.955You are injured.956There is a commotion in the capital.Some assassins attacked him last night.957Do not kill him!Kill him.958He is a soul shifter.Come on out!959I will.Jang Uk.960I do not think it is right to let a magewho has barged in here leave so easily.961Once they run wild,there is no turning back.962They will no longer be humans,but monsters.963We can also protectthe monsters from this world.964Subtitle translation by Jawon Lee965Please rate this subtitle at www.osdb.linkagzwdHelp other users to choose the best subtitles"

It was a cakewalk to beat him.166Are you ready for your match?Of course.167At the very end, I will use Hyeongong to168He is a mage from the Cha familywho can use Hyeongong.169He had been watching Uk all along.170He is a coward who has only stepped upafter seeing Uk lose several times.171Uk might be able to beat him.172Hyeongong is a spell thatmay look fancy on the outside.173But it will be uselessif the user lacks the skills.174Beom may look intimidatingat first glance,175but that could just be a front.176Yul sure can see through others.177Is that so?178But he was telling othersabout how easy it would be179to beat Young Master Jang.180He is just worried.181Uk has improved greatlyin the past several days.182He is scared that Uk will beat him.183I guess my young master has improvedquite a bit for him to be worried.184Are you that thrilledthat Uk has become stronger?185Of course. I cannot be any prouder.186Naksu is training Uk.187Yul.188Did you hear?189There is a commotion in the capital.190What happened?191Master Kang from Daegangtongunsuccumbed to his illness.192But rumor has it193that some assassinsattacked him last night.194My uncle and Master Heorushed over to his funeral.195What if more assassinslike Naksu have appeared?196THE LATE KANG MANCHEON197Why can we not offer our condolences?198Transporting precious goodsis our family business.199But if people find outthat the man of the house200was killed by some assassins,we could become jobless.201We told everyonehe died of a contagious disease.202That is why no one can enter.203We understand.204Have you found any evidencethat could help us find the assassins?205Has an autopsy been carried out?206Master Kang was stabbed to deathin front of our eyes.207An autopsy is unnecessary.208We will cremate his body tonight.209That soon?210It is unfortunate.211But we must hurrybefore the rumor spreads.212I am certain Master Kang would havealso wanted this for his family.213That is unacceptable.214If you cremate his body,215there will be no evidencethat will link to the assassins.216This is a family matter.217I understand that you are worried.218But the leader of Songrimdoes not need to concern himself with it.219An autopsy is needed.220Postpone the cremation.221Has Songrim gone as far as to meddlein other families funerals?222We are not meddling.223I am simply trying to preventthe new man of the house224from making an irreversible mistake.225Why is Songrims leader against this?226What gives you the right?227Only recently did Naksu attackthe mages in the capital.228Now, new assassins have emerged.229There could be a link between this caseand Naksu who used sorcery.230That is why I am interfering.231There was no sorcery involved.232I witnessed it all.233How can you be so sure without an autopsy?234The new man of the housedoes not want an autopsy.235Jin Mu! You have no say in this.236We have the right to interfereif there are suspicions237of sorcery being involved.238Do you not agree, Lady Jin?239I believe240the Assistant Gwanju is right this time.241The familys heir witnessedMaster Kangs death.242And he has no choice but to hide itdue to their family business.243No evidence hintedat sorcery being involved.244So I do not think Songrimshould cause a commotion here.245I just want to protect his honor.246Please let us proceedwith this funeral discreetly.247Jin Mu does not hesitateto look down on Songrim now.248Why are they so against the idea?249It is suspicious.By the way,250I had no ideaLady Jin would take Jin Mus side.251She used to hate her halfbrother.252I was truly pleased when you took my side.253Look.254Songrim had no choice but to back downonce we joined hands.255How close are you to finding Buyeon?256We searched all the areasaround Lake Gyeongcheondaeho257for blind girlswho were around Buyeons age.258I have been doing that for ten years now.259To be honest,260I believe I foundthe whereabouts of Buyeon.261A young girl had washed upnear the lake ten years ago.262Is that so?However263she was long dead.264Mother, I doubt that was her.265I told my men to dig up her grave.266If Buyeon truly is dead,267I will bring her bodyback to you at all costs.268That is unacceptable.269Bring my daughter back alive.270I will, so please calm down.271We will find her alive.272Did you take a good look?273They will be your motherand younger sister.274Do you think275they will think that I am their daughter?276You are dressed277like Buyeon when she was young.278But I am not sure if Hogyeong will agree.279Then being welldressed280will not benefit us.281I must look shabbier and more pathetic.282She is a mother who has lost her daughter.283I can only win her heartby pulling at her heartstrings.284Yes.285You are right, Soi.286I will see to it287that I become a daughterof the Jin family.288You look much better now.289I tend to recover quickly.290This Hyeongong technique291is quite elaborate.292I have my suspicionsregarding Master Kangs death.293Master Kang was powerfulwith a great mastery of spells.294But he was already sufferingfrom a fatal illness.295There was no need for anyoneto send the assassins.296Maybe someone had a grudge against him297and wanted to kill him themselves.298No.299There must be a reason300why those assassins came,although we do not know yet.301Once the soul is shifted,the former body becomes useless.302But we cannot get rid of it that easily.303In other peoples eyes,that body belongs to a powerful mage,304an administrative officer, or a merchant.305They will only suspect somethingif that individual disappears.306Naksu was the one who took care of them.307Do you mean the Shadow Assassin?308Thanks to that crazy assassin,309Songrim never suspectedthat I was making soul shifters.310Back when I was after Naksu,311I thought she was just a lunaticwho wanted to show off her skills.312That is why I never suspectedthe individuals that she killed.313Are you saying that she killed those314whose souls have been shifted by Jin Mu?315To be exact,316they must have been thosewho were discarded afterward.317Did you not saythat Naksu was Cho Chungs daughter?318Are you saying he took that little girland turned her into an assassin?319That is why I never revealed myself to her320and made her livein the mountains by herself.321I took care of herjust enough for her to survive.322But she was determinedand grew to be remarkably strong.323Because324She thought by doing soshe would be avenging her parents.325That is why she obeyed Jin Mu.326She was very useful.327Then a soul shifter ran wild before dying.328Thanks to him,329Songrim got wind of the alchemy of souls.330Once Jin Mu heard that we were after her,331he was probably afraid of getting caught.332He probably sent Naksu to Songrimdespite knowing that she would die.333Mudeok, go and get some water.334Yes, maam.335Mudeok, will you seriouslynot listen to me?336I told you to just get some rest.337Then what about you?338Did I not tell you to treat your wounds?339I stopped by Sejukwon.At least I listened to you.340Check for yourself.341I smell mugwort.342What is wrong with you?343You know I am struggling these days.I am just exhausted.344How warm.345Did you get a hot mugwort massage?346Yes. I am warm, right?347Yes. You are.348She was used for all the wrong reasonsand met a terrible death.349Naksu350I truly pity her.351You are cool now. Let me go.352Did you change your shoes?Yes.353Did you have the foodMaidservant Kim brought?354Yes. I had already had somebefore you even mentioned them.355Well done. Mudeok.356I did not know how fascinating this was.357The yinandyang jade?358I only found out because you had given itto the Crown Prince.359How is it fascinating?360Show me.I cannot.361I will show you362once I get yours back.363You will give it to me again364after you get it back?365Why? Will you not accept it?366I will retrieve itand place it in your hand.367This thing has unbelievable powers.368It is a relief we did not know.369You are in for a shock once I get it back.370What kind of powers? Show me.371The Crown Princefoamed in the mouth and fainted.372It was terrifying.373That makes sense. It was from Jinyowon.374It could be a lethal weapon.375Hello, Assistant Gwanju.376The leader of Songrim returned377to watch the cremation for himself.378What will you do this time around?379I am only here to observe.380This is the last timeI will ever see Master Kang.381It is my duty to see him off.382You have seen a soul shifter before,383so you will recognize the blue mark.384Check and see if Master Kangs bodyhad been used for soul shifting.385Even if we find outthat he has shifted souls,386we will not knowwhose body he has shifted into.387There is something you must doto help us find that out.388I know that you havealready mastered Chisu.389I did not hide it on purpose.390I am not scolding you.391What I am about to ask you to do392is quite dangerousand might suck away your energy.393Only thosewho have mastered Chisu can do it.394A soul shifter runs wildonce their energy is lost.395The body is still warm.396Pour your energy into him.397and make him run wild.398My lord399What is it?400He is401I will collect his bones, so step aside.402This is a soul shifter403who has been petrified after running wild.404Now that we have solid evidenceof sorcery being involved,405can Songrim take over?406Seeing how you are not disturbedand even tried to hide it,407you must have already known about this.408You already knew409that this was a soul shifterwho had run wild.410Judging by your skills,411I believe Master Kangs soulis within that body.412Then that bodys original soul413must be dead alongside your body.414Cut that nonsense!415You are running wild416after having lost blood and energy.417The more you use your skills,the faster you will become petrified.418You better stop.419You should stop here.420Do not kill him!Kill him.421A soul shifter who is running wildis dangerous.422Thankfully, Cheonbugwan got rid of him.423Since you have helped us,424we will let Songrim take credit for this.425My lord.Yes?426Since you said we could take credit,427we will take the body and examine it.428Be my guest.429I closed his gate of energy430to prevent more energy from seeping out.431We need to revive him and make him talk.432Will it be possible?433He is pretty much a breathing stone.Yet you want him to speak?434This will not be easy.435Are you worriedthat he may still be alive?436Even so, they will not succeed.437Perhaps it is possiblewith the help of the ice stone.438But that is their only bet.439Are you saying he can be revivedwith the ice stone?440That is correct.441And you are in possession of that stone?442You do not need to know that.443Get the assassins ready.444I will find a way445even if it means shifting the soulof a Jeongjingak mage.446Hey, Beom.What?447Let us go.448THE ART OF HYEONGONG449PRESSING THE HEAD OF A LEOPARD STANCE450DIRECT SENDING STANCE, CAULDRON STANCE451Yul.452Uk.453Are you going to train?454Yes.455And you?456I just slashed457a soul shifter.458Master Kang who had passed away yesterdaywas a soul shifter.459Really?460But how did you know that?461If they hide their blue mark,462they can easily blend inwith other people.463But once they run wild,464there is no turning back.465They will start to petrifyas their energy seeps out.466They can prevent thatby feeding on others energy.467But once they do that,468they will no longer be humans,but monsters.469Monsters?470And it is our duty to protect this world471from such monsters.472We can also protectthe monsters from this world.473Once we keep them in check,474the world will be at peace.475Everyone had high hopes for youever since you were little,476so you thinkyou need to do something grand.477But I was told478to sit still all my life.479I will follow480my heart.481Jin Mu let Songrim find outsomething critical.482What if Songrim suspectsthe palace as well?483The Royal Palace484is not a place he can just barge intolike he did at Daegangtongun.485If he does, I will be in danger.486Ever since Gilju died,487I was not able to feed on energy.488I am afraid I will run wild.489Could you share some of the power490of the ice stone with me?491What did you say?492The only person who can serve youdespite knowing your true face493is only me, is it not?494Shaman.495You little496I told you never to address me like that.497Would you liketo be petrified this instant?498I know you cannot do that.499I am the only one in this palace500who knows that you are Shaman Choi,501despite residing in the Queens body.502If I die,503you will bring your sibling herefrom Jinyowon?504Furthermore,505the real Queen is residing in your body.506Should I not visit her from time to time?507Right?508It is getting difficult for me509to live in this body.510Tell Jin Mu511to shift my soulinto someone elses body once again,512Your Highness.513I understand.514You may leave.515Why are you here?516I will let you beat me.Then it will all be over.517I forfeit.518Hey, Uk!519You wanted to go before me.520And you won.521Danggu was willing to let you beat him.522How could you refuse?523I did not knowyou were this proud of yourself.524You gave me this signaland told me not to fight him.525When did I?526I only looked at you out of relief.527Then you should have signaled me.528Like this.529I did.530How could I understand that?Had I known, I would have just done it.531You only have one chance left.532What will you do?533What, are you blaming me?534Why are you getting mad at mewhen you gave that jade to him?535Are you seriouslypointing fingers right now?536How childish.537Childish? Do you want meto show you what real childishness is?538I quit.539Should I keep this up?540Mages have been guardingSejukwon since last night.541The soul shifters body must be in there.542If it was a body, they would havekept it in the secret room.543Why would they take it to Sejukwon,which is for the living?544I came by because I was curiousabout what happened to the body.545Please wait. I will inform our leader.546I heard the leader was here at Sejukwon,so I came to see him.547No one is allowedto enter Sejukwon at the moment.548Then I will meetwith Young Master Jang first.549Please tell the leader that I am here.550Jin Mu is here551to check if the soul shifterhas really died or not.552Tell him to leavesince we are still investigating.553Yes, my lord. However,someone else is here to see you.554Tell them to leave.555No one is allowed anywhere near Sejukwon.556Yes, my lord.557I will tell Maidservant Kimto leave as well.558What?559Maidservant Kim?560I will tell herthat the leader cannot meet anyone.561Hold on.562She can be an exception.563It has been a long time, Maidservant Kim.564I stayed at Gwanju Jang Gangs residencewhen I served him,565and you made mecountless delicious dishes.566You ate so much567that your rice bowl was exceptionally big.568Do you remember?569You had a huge brass bowl.570Back in the day, I was always hungry.571You must have madesomething scrumptious once again.572Yes, I have. I made these snacks myself.573Honey biscuits.I used to love them back in the day.574Yes, indeed.575Every time I gave some to youto give to the Gwanju,576you would stash a few in your pockets.577I did that because I was only allowedto eat once he finished.578In any case, I benefited a lotfrom the Gwanju while following him.579I had a chance to tastesuch delicious treats580and learn a special spell.581Does it not taste sweeterif you eat it in secret?582That is exactly why583things that taste sweet are dangerous.584Once you have a taste of it,you desire it at all costs.585You fail to distinguish586what you can have587and what you cannot.588You are hurting my feelingsby not letting me have any.589Goodness, do not be so stingy with food.590The Gwanju loved this snack.591How about his son?592Young Master Uk loveshoney biscuits as well.593Then shall we share this with him?594I have many storiesto tell him about his father.595You and Uk have nothing to talk about.596You may leave.597He just wants a biscuit.Do not be so heartless.598You are not letting me sharethe good memories with him.599But then again,600you must not want meto touch what is yours.601Wait.602Here. This was actuallyfor our young master,603but you can have it instead.604Maidservant Kim.605Do not give that to him.606If I truly wanted to have some,607I would have easily stolen a few of them.608But I will let you win.609It had been a while since we last met.I am truly sad to say goodbye.610Jin Mu used to take revenge611if he was scolded for eating something.612They were just honey biscuits.613You should have let him have them.614I just did not want him to eat615what you worked so hard to make.616Sit down.617We have not seen each other in a while.618Let us chat over some tea.619Is something wrong?620You seem quite testy.621Do not worry.622Once I have your honey biscuits,I will feel better.623Mudeok.624I need you to run an errand.625An errand? What is it?626Go to Cheonbugwan.627This just does not feel right,so I need to send this over.628Sure.629Is something going on at Sejukwon?630I do not know the details.631But I think it is relatedto last nights incident at Daegangtongun.632I heard Cheonbugwanand Songrim had a fight.633Where is Yul?634I have not seen him since last night.635He must be doing something for the leader.636Really?637I just slashed638a soul shifter.639We must strengthen Songrims boundaries.640You are forbiddenfrom leaving Songrim for the time being.641Those who have mastered Ryusu and more642shall go to Sejukwonand follow Sanghos orders.643Yes, my lord.Yes, my lord.644Jang Uk.645You will stay here.646Everyone except for Uk647will follow Sangho and go to Sejukwon.648Yes, my lord.Yes, my lord.649My lord.650Why am I not going?651You are exemptsince we do not need you there.652Is there something dangerous there?653Is it a soul shifter?654It is none of your concern.655Do not be curious about it.656Why are you keeping me in the darkwhen I am also a mage here?657You are excluded from everything.658If you are bored of being alone,you may leave Songrim.659Go back to your homeand do whatever makes you comfortable.660Yes, my lord.Thank you for worrying about my comfort.661Mudeok.662Let us go to Chwiseonruand have something tasty.663All the mages were headed to Sejukwon.Why are you not there?664I was told to stay out of it665and that I did not needto concern myself with the matter.666Let us go.Maidservant Kim gave me an errand to do.667Sure. Let us go together. Where to?668Cheonbugwan.669Let us go.670I heard that you told herto shift you into another body.671Will you do that?672Then let me shift souls with that girlwho will enter Jinyowon as Jin Buyeon.673I have been a eunuch for a while,674so I do not mind a womans body.675I would like to shift my soulinto a powerful body like the Shaman has.676Shaman.677She was offended by how you reminded her678that she was a shaman dealingwith trifling affairs like divinations.679I was only stating a fact.680I was also reminded today of how I usedto beg for food and steal snacks.681They were indeed facts,but I was still unhappy to hear them.682Jin Mu wanted a honey biscuitwhile visiting Songrim,683but Park Jin did not let him have any.684Maidservant Kim was worriedhe would hold a grudge,685so she wanted me to deliver this.686Are you saying they were childish enoughto fight over some food?687Our leader has a cheap wayof tormenting others.688Why was he so picky about a honey biscuit?689You are right. He was cheap.690Here, at Cheonbugwan,691we have records of all the constellations.692I will tell the Assistant Gwanjuthat this was from the Jang family.693Please tell him thatit was from Maidservant Kim.694Tell him that we use a lot of oilin our honey biscuits695and that he should have themwith green tea.696Yes, Young Master Jang.697We also use a lot of honeyfor our honey biscuits.698He should store them in a cool placeor they will become sticky.699Yes, Young Master Jang.Since we have brought that,700can I take a look inside?Yes701Sorry?Thank you.

Almost there.60MANFive, four, three, two...61iFanfare playsi62Good morning.63Last week it was announcedby the prison authorities64that the new governor of theriottorn prison Barfield65was to be Helen Hewitt.66Miss Hewitt has joined usin the studio today.67 Good morning to you, Helen. Morning.68At 33, you arethe youngest woman governor69in charge ofan allmale category B prison.70Yes, thats correct.71And as if that werentenough of a challenge,72youll also be overseeingthe governments plans73for the refurbishmentof Barfield.74Yes, I am.75Now, the press believethat your appointment76may have beena publicity stunt...77I do not believethat my appointment78was in any waya publicityseeking campaign79by the prison services.80Also joining us this morningis Sarah Smith.81Sarah, you feel very differentlyabout criminals, dont you?82Eight years ago,I was raped and mugged83only a few yardsfrom my own home.84I sustained injuries to my spine85and have been unable to walkany distance since.86My house was recently burgled,although the police doubted87if the two crimeswere connected.88I was unable to dealwith the terror that he had...89the man who raped me,had come back.90There was a reason for that,wasnt there?91Yes, he threatened me.92He said he knew where I lived93and he would alwaysbe able to find me.94And you connected the burglarywith the rapist?95Yes, I did.96You see, by that time97hed already been releasedfrom his prison.98WOMANAnd how did this make you feel?99Angry. Very angry!100I live with a life sentence,not him.101I just want to knowthat hes locked up102and unable to hurtand abuse another woman.103Miss Hewitt, do you believethat more government support104is given to the criminalthan to the victim?105Every victimhas a right to justice.106Of course they do.But that is not my job.107That is the jobof the law courts.108My job is to ensure that theperpetrators are rehabilitated109so that when they leave prison,110they are no longera threat to society.111SMITHBut it doesnt work.112The man who raped meraped another woman113six months after his release.114Well, considering the costto keep a prisoner115in luxury today,its not surprising...116Why doesnt the government117spend more money on the victimsand not the criminals?118The main costs areto ensure total security,119so that a prisoner cannot escapeand endanger the public.120II do understandand feel for the victims,121such as Miss Smith,122and of course,they should be cared for,123but there areat this present time124over 50,000 men in prison.125We cannot operate126a lock them upand throw away the key regime,127which achievesabsolutely nothing.128We must at all costsrehabilitate them129so that they do not reoffend.130Sarah, did you receiveany compensation?1312,500.1322,500.133Its a very small amountin comparison134with the estimated 40 millionworth of damage done135during the recent riotsat Barfield.136Surely if the intentionwas to rehabilitate137the men held there,then it failed.138The comfort, or thesoftly, softly approach...139Ive no intention of applyinga soft approach140to my term as governor.141In todays paperit was announced142that Barfield has been allocated60 million for the rebuild.143Surely this isan astronomical amount of money.144I have not been informedas to the exact amount145to be allocated to Barfield.146Really?It was in iThe Independenti today.147Perhaps this is an indicationof mismanagement.148Sadly, yet again, the victimsof crime seem to be the losers.149Was anyone at Barfield informed?150MAN Yes. There wasemail notification.151How could it possiblyget leaked to the press152without prior consultationwith me?153I cant say, but it musthave come from HQ.154I would like to see those plans.155Yes, I know youare my area manager,156but dont you think that sinceI am the governor in charge,157I may possibly havesome suggestions?158Ill arrange it.159As youre in London,say, half an hour?160Thats absolutely fine.Ill be there.161Has anyone from Barfieldbeen shown these designs?162I really wouldnt know.Im just the architect.163Well, it would make senseto ask people working there164for their input, wouldnt it?165Well, I have only had dealingswith the prison authorities.166The new priorityis to be the plumbing.167Stainless steel toiletsand wash basins to each cell.168These men spend 12 hours a dayinside these cells.169They also eatall of their meals in there.170It is totally insanitary.171Whats this?172A proposed football pitch.173AstroTurf.174AstroTurf?175Well, no wonderits costing 60 million.176This a swimming pool, is it?177This is proposed to be builtinside the new larger perimeter,178and is a complete secure unit.179Is it an SSU or a control unit?180A sort of prisonwithin the prison.181Cellphone rings182You mean a secure unit,Mr. Greenleaves.183In America,it is nicknamed the cage,184but from your design,185it resemblesa fourstar YMCA hostel.186 Yes. Miss Hewitt?187 Speaking.

Im a declared bankrupt.196They can charge mewith what the hell they like.197How much? Hey?Now, come on, you two.198How muchare they trying to get me for?199Its not just the Inland Revenueand value added tax.200Transporting anythingis a very costly business.201Well, there must be a wayto salvage the original plan.202I dont care what it costs.203Now, look, this building hereis under construction.204And this one too.205Now, are you telling me206that theres no wayto get access to this area?207We might get round it,but it will cost.208WOMAN Mr. Maynard is solicitedto court two.209 Are they ready for the hearing? Yes, sir.210Oh!Trying to clean me out.211Lets go.212Theres no way that we can, uh,213get rid of these forthe hearing, is there, you know?214I mean, they knowIve been nicked, you know?215No need to overplay your hand,you know,216and lose the sympathy vote,is there?217How much?Five grand?

Almost there.54Five, four, three, two...55Good morning.56Last week it was announcedby the prison authorities57that the new governor of theriottorn prison Barfield58was to be Helen Hewitt.59Miss Hewitt has joined usin the studio today.60 Good morning to you, Helen. Morning.61At 33, you arethe youngest woman governor62in charge ofan allmale category B prison.63Yes, thats correct.64And as if that werentenough of a challenge,65youll also be overseeingthe governments plans66for the refurbishmentof Barfield.67Yes, I am.68Now, the press believethat your appointment69may have beena publicity stunt...70I do not believethat my appointment71was in any waya publicityseeking campaign72by the prison services.73Also joining us this morningis Sarah Smith.74Sarah, you feel very differentlyabout criminals, dont you?75Eight years ago,I was raped and mugged76only a few yardsfrom my own home.77I sustained injuries to my spine78and have been unable to walkany distance since.79My house was recently burgled,although the police doubted80if the two crimeswere connected.81I was unable to dealwith the terror that he had...82the man who raped me,had come back.83There was a reason for that,wasnt there?84Yes, he threatened me.85He said he knew where I lived86and he would alwaysbe able to find me.87And you connected the burglarywith the rapist?88Yes, I did.89You see, by that time90hed already been releasedfrom his prison.91And how did this make you feel?92Angry. Very angry!93I live with a life sentence,not him.94I just want to knowthat hes locked up95and unable to hurtand abuse another woman.96Miss Hewitt, do you believethat more government support97is given to the criminalthan to the victim?98Every victimhas a right to justice.99Of course they do.But that is not my job.100That is the jobof the law courts.101My job is to ensure that theperpetrators are rehabilitated102so that when they leave prison,103they are no longera threat to society.104But it doesnt work.105The man who raped meraped another woman106six months after his release.107Well, considering the costto keep a prisoner108in luxury today,its not surprising...109Why doesnt the government110spend more money on the victimsand not the criminals?111The main costs areto ensure total security,112so that a prisoner cannot escapeand endanger the public.113II do understandand feel for the victims,114such as Miss Smith,115and of course,they should be cared for,116but there areat this present time117over 50,000 men in prison.118We cannot operate119a lock them upand throw away the key regime,120which achievesabsolutely nothing.121We must at all costsrehabilitate them122so that they do not reoffend.123Sarah, did you receiveany compensation?1242,500.1252,500.126Its a very small amountin comparison127with the estimated 40 millionworth of damage done128during the recent riotsat Barfield.129Surely if the intentionwas to rehabilitate130the men held there,then it failed.131The comfort, or thesoftly, softly approach...132Ive no intention of applyinga soft approach133to my term as governor.134In todays paperit was announced135that Barfield has been allocated60 million for the rebuild.136Surely this isan astronomical amount of money.137I have not been informedas to the exact amount138to be allocated to Barfield.139Really?It was in iThe Independenti today.140Perhaps this is an indicationof mismanagement.141Sadly, yet again, the victimsof crime seem to be the losers.142Was anyone at Barfield informed?143Yes. There wasemail notification.144How could it possiblyget leaked to the press145without prior consultationwith me?146I cant say, but it musthave come from HQ.147I would like to see those plans.148Yes, I know youare my area manager,149but dont you think that sinceI am the governor in charge,150I may possibly havesome suggestions?151Ill arrange it.152As youre in London,say, half an hour?153Thats absolutely fine.Ill be there.154Has anyone from Barfieldbeen shown these designs?155I really wouldnt know.Im just the architect.156Well, it would make senseto ask people working there157for their input, wouldnt it?158Well, I have only had dealingswith the prison authorities.159The new priorityis to be the plumbing.160Stainless steel toiletsand wash basins to each cell.161These men spend 12 hours a dayinside these cells.162They also eatall of their meals in there.163It is totally insanitary.164Whats this?165A proposed football pitch.166AstroTurf.167AstroTurf?168Well, no wonderits costing 60 million.169This a swimming pool, is it?170This is proposed to be builtinside the new larger perimeter,171and is a complete secure unit.172Is it an SSU or a control unit?173A sort of prisonwithin the prison.174You mean a secure unit,Mr. Greenleaves.175In America,it is nicknamed the cage,176but from your design,177it resemblesa fourstar YMCA hostel.178 Yes. Miss Hewitt?179Speaking.180No, I dont carewhat his solicitor says.181I want Maynard cuffed to anofficer throughout that hearing.182Without more time183we were unableto accommodate your request.184What the hellam I paying you two for?185Theres no way they can freezethose accounts, is there?186Mr. Maynard, its gonebeyond that stage.187 Youre being charged. Im a declared bankrupt.188They can charge mewith what the hell they like.189How much? Hey?Now, come on, you two.190How muchare they trying to get me for?191Its not just the Inland Revenueand value added tax.192Transporting anythingis a very costly business.193Well, there must be a wayto salvage the original plan.194I dont care what it costs.195Now, look, this building hereis under construction.196And this one too.197Now, are you telling me198that theres no wayto get access to this area?199We might get round it,but it will cost.200Mr. Maynard is solicitedto court two.201 Are they ready for the hearing? Yes, sir.202Oh!Trying to clean me out.203Lets go.204Theres no way that we can, uh,205get rid of these forthe hearing, is there, you know?206I mean, they knowIve been nicked, you know?207No need to overplay your hand,you know,208and lose the sympathy vote,is there?209How much?Five grand? Ten?210No? 20?211Final offer... 30 large.212Just joking.213Can you do it?214Im gonna have to findone hell of a pilot.215 Mr. Morgan...

Great.861Heres a hard copyof my itinerary.862Its gonna be tight,863but Ive gota 330 flight tomorrow864that Ive got to catch.865Im speaking at UCLA,and then Im off to Japan.866And if I dont fit insome family time,867my wife will kill me,you know what I mean?868 Yeah.869I was up all nightwith a sick kid.870 Oh, I know what its like.871Last year,I took my kids down the Amazon.872One of em came backwith a tapeworm.873I didnt sleep for a week.874This is perfect.875I thinkyoure gonna be very excited876with what weve put together.877Slaters was trying to competeagainst the superstores878using EDLP modeling.879And of course,you cant compete with that.880Its the same with Wolskis.881You cant beat them on priceevery time882or go chasingtheir specials pricing.883Wolskis needs something newto compete.884What were proposingis predictive analysis885at a level unheard ofin this industry.886 This is what we were pushingat Slaters,887but they just wouldnt listen.888 Well, to be fair,this industry889seems particularly slowto adapt to new trends,890but thereare big opportunities here.891Susan wanted big ideas.892 All right,just so I can find some way893to translate all of this894What were seeing is,were better off895choosing select productsfor big discounts896rather thanthe hybrid incentives897were using right now.898 Correct.899And the keyis which products we select.900Were not justselling the product.901We are selling our image.902Each featured productwill announce to the customer903who we are,what makes us special,904not just the productbut the kind of products.905Were not offeringspecial prices.906We are offering...907specialness.908 What aboutour other competitors?909Did you get a chanceto review their strategies?910 Well, as far as we can tell,911none of the other shopsare doing anything like this.912Its very exciting. Laughs913 But theres a big qualifier.914Its all comes downto implementation.915If you couldput all these strategies916into your stores tomorrow,917wed be two yearsahead of everybody,918but realistically,I know how long it takes919to work these thingsthrough the chain.920Once the strategiesstart to go into your stores,921your competitorsare gonna notice.922 So after two years,theres almost no advantage.923 Theres a declining function.924But when these strategiesgo into your stores,925your market sharewill grow 8 to 10926within three months.927 8 to 10? Wow.928 After time,these numbers decline steeply.929Stealing ideas is what passesfor RD in this business.930 So has ACS spokento the vendors about all this?931 Pete, shh.932 Im sorry.933I thought ACS was behind youon this.934 Its complicated.935 Youre so happyto go to work these days.936 I know.I just... 937I feel better about it now,938like what Im doingmight actually have some value.939 Pricing groceries?940 I joined the gymnear the office,941thought Id start goingduring lunch.942Got you a membership too.943 Scoffs944Im getting fat, huh?945 No.It was only 10 bucks.946 When am I gonna have a chanceto go to the gym?947 You just got to make time.948Susan goesat 500 in the morning.949 Susan doesnt have kids.950 Youre kidding me!951That Cartwright!952Jesus Christ!953Pete Cozy!954Jesus Christ!955Someone from ACSgot wind that we were using956Slaters strategiesfrom Intellichoice.957I dont know how, but nowthey want to sideline us.958They want us to try outour strategies959at one of their storesand see how they fly.960 Isnt that normal,to see how things work out?961 Fuck that!962No, Im not gonna sit aroundand let Stop  Shop963decide if our experimentworks for them.964Whats the fucking pointof that?965Take what we have, go home,and pack a bag.966Sighs967Well figure something outon the plane.968Donna?969Bennington will get this.970 Bennington, the CEO?971 Yeah, who else?972 Where is that suit,the one I wore to Jims wedding?973 I dont thinkits gonna fit you.974 Can you just help mefind it?975 How come your old bossnever took you to L.

9181995,"1Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLESFree Browser extension osdb.linkext2Good morning,this is Orson Welles speaking.3Id like to read to you an affidavit.4I, Isaac Woodard Jr.,being duly sworn do depose5and state as follows.6I am 27 years old and a veteranof the United States Army,7having served for 15 monthsin the South Pacific,8and earned one battle star.9While I was in uniformI purchased a ticket10to Winnsboro, South Carolina,and took the bus headed there11to pick up my wife to come to New York12to see my father and mother.13About one hour out of Atlanta,the bus drivers got off14and went and got the police.15The policeman grabbed meby my left arm and twisted it16behind my back.17I figured he was tryingto make me resist.18I did not resist against him.19Another policeman held his gun on me20while the other one was beating me.21I started to get up, he startedpunching me in my eyes.22He knocked me unconscious.23I woke up next morningand could not see.24They took me to the veterans hospital25in Columbia, South Carolina.26They told me I should joina blind school.27You have a man28wearing a dress uniform.29He has medals on his chest.30All the symbols of sacrificeand service are there31and it doesnt matter,it just doesnt matter.32To a white Southerner in 1946,33nothing is more provocativethan a Black man in uniform.34You have lawenforcement coming with the full savagery35of Southern racism.36No one can say thatwhat happened to Isaac Woodard37was justified.38It just seemed to be something39that shouldnt happen in America.40Now it seems the officer of the law41was just another white man with a stick42who wanted to teach a Negro boy a lesson,43to show a Negro boy wherehe belonged in the darkness.44Are we going to havepeople who live in the United States45and are less equal than others?46What are we going to do about this?47You say the North is bullying the South.48Im afraid youre missing the point.49This isnt another battlefieldof the Civil War.50The sides arent the blue and the gray.51They are the right and the wrong.52Who would have guessed53that the blinding of a heroic veteran54would be the beginning of theend of Jim Crow in America?55Going home...56thats the sweetest wordsa G.I. ever heard.57Back to the good old U.S.A.,58where just the formality of mustering out,59and then home sweet home.60For the G.I.sdischarged just hours earlier,61the wait inside the Greyhoundbus terminal was excruciating.62They were on the final legof a journey that had taken them63halfway around the world and back.64Freedom was so closethey could nearly taste it.65The soldiers that were there,66they had to have been jubilant and proud.67Happy to return home, on your soil.68So, it had to have been justan exciting time for all of them69to go home and see their families, finally.70On the 800Augusta to Columbia coach that night71was Sergeant Isaac Woodard,72headed home to Winnsboro,South Carolina, to see his wife73for the first time in several years.74Woodard was still in uniform,75carrying a battle starfor bravery under fire,76and a final paycheckfrom the U.S. Army77in the extraordinary sum of 695,78enough to start the kind of life79he hadnt dared dream of before the war.80Like the other 900,000AfricanAmerican soldiers81returning home from duty,82Isaac Woodard had come to seethis bright new future83as his due.84African Americans hadfought in all of the major wars85in American history, and theredalways been this theme of86if we fight and we show our loyalty,87then we are going to advanceand be recognized88as more equal citizens.89And that dream had always been frustrated.90But World War II was actuallyquite different from past wars91for African Americans becauseit was a special kind of war.92This war, this particular war,93crystalizes around the ideaof this fight against fascism.94And that means that it isa fight against inequality,95of suppressing groups of peoplebecause of their race.96So you have Black soldiers coming home,97having been inculcatedwith the idea that America98stands for something differentthan fascism,99something different than racialand ethnic discrimination.100Something better.101By 1000on that February evening,102Isaac Woodard was little morethan an hour away103from his homecoming in Winnsboro.104The atmosphere on the bus is jovial,105filled with the relief that soldiers feel106after surviving 15 months at war.107Black soldiers and whitesoldiers are talking together,108joking together.109Eventually a bottle of whiskeygets opened and passed around.110There were a few nonsoldiers on the bus111and they were very uncomfortable112with the interaction betweenthe white and Black soldiers.113There were complaints to the bus driver114and the bus driver didnt like it.115There are, of course, in 1946,116no bathroom facilities117on public buses.118Isaac Woodard asked thebus driver if at the next stop119he could be allowed to disembarkand to go to the bathroom.120And the bus driver tells him,121Boy, go sit back down.122The bus driver cursed him.123Isaac Woodard cursed him back124and proclaimed his manhood.125He just said to thegentleman, You know, you dont have to126speak to me in that manner,Im a man just like you.127In other words,Give me respect.128Military training and service129turned a Black man fromthe rural Deep South130with a fifth grade education131into a man willing to say words132that he knew could put his life at risk.133There is no doubt134when he said that,that he was under any illusions135about what he was saying,where he was saying it...136on a bus, at night, in the Deep South.137But he was a veteran.138He was wearing the uniform.139He was surrounded by veteranswho were wearing the uniforms.140They were returning from a warthat they had won.141And he was a stronger man because of it.142The bus driver is furious.143At the next town,144he goes looking for a police officer145to have Woodard removed from his bus.146Woodards kind of perplexed.147He steps off the bus148and as hes trying to explain himself,149the police chief brings out his blackjack,150which is like a baton,151but its springloadedand it, it has tremendous force,152and hits Woodard over the head with it.153A soldier aboard thebus watched as the officer took Woodard154by the arm and forced him aroundthe corner and out of sight.155That is the last I saw of him,156he would tell investigatorsa few months later.157They started beating himall across the head.158And they gouge his eyes out.159They didnt beat them out.160They put the stick in there and twisted it.161They threw him in jail and he told me162they poured whiskey over himto say he was drunk.163He was arrested for, supposedly,disorderly conduct,164disturbing the peace, and being drunk.165He was not drunk.166He was not being disorderly.167And he did not disturb the peace.168He spends the night in jail, unable to see,169in excruciating pain.170The next morning he is taken to the judge.171He is levied a fine,but he cant see to sign172the paperwork that is put before him.173Ultimately, when Woodardis examined by specialists,174they determine that he willnever see again.175The injuries are severeand they are irreversible.176He will be blind for life.177You spend 42 months in the military,178overseas in the Philippines,and you come home to this.179How can you just gouge someones eyes out?180Anybody, how can...you cant do that.181And it hurts me to even thinkabout it, but it happened.182Its sad.183Well, that was, Id say,a part of ignorance.184You know, thats the bottomline, plain ignorance.185As World War II ended,186900,000 AfricanAmerican veterans187returned to America...18875 of them to the South,189most of them to the rural South.190The war took Blacksoldiers out of communities191where they had to adhereto a certain set of social norms192in which they were subservient193and opened up possibilities.194Even a segregated army195gave chances for training and leadership,196and advancement and recognition.197Those in Europe had been treatedvery respectfully.198And for the first time in their lives,199the color of their skin was notthe predominant200characteristic to whichthey were identified.201They came home feelinglike they had done their duty202in defense of American democracyand liberty.203But, when they returned home,204they largely saw nothing had changed.205White Southerners of that era considered206the returning soldiersto be potential trouble,207not great American citizens.208As some would say,they no longer knew their place.209Black soldiers wereespecially threatening to210the racial moresthat undermined segregation.211Black soldiers were in uniform.212They wore emblems of authority.213They often carried themselveswith a sense of authority214that the enforcers of white supremacy215found particularly threatening.216Wearingthe uniform of the U.S. military217grants one the prerogatives of citizenship.218And Black men make no bonesabout the fact that they feel219completely deserving of those prerogatives.220And they become the target.221So, in 1946, what you see is one incident222of racial violence after another.223There was littlerecourse... and little protection...224for the AfricanAmerican veterans225victimized in the South.226Investigating these hate crimesoften fell to a small team227of lawyers at the228National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People,229headed by Thurgood Marshall.230The N.A.A.C.P.is just inundated with cases231of violence against Black soldiers,232wrongful court martials,233massive riots, slaughter.234And Thurgood Marshalls officehad files from floor to ceiling235of these cases.236A harrowing new reportlanded in the N.A.A.C.P. legal office237almost every week in 1946.238One Black Army veteranwas murdered on his front porch239in Taylor County, Georgia.240His offense had been casting avote in the Democratic primary.241A week later, 120 miles away,242a Black veteran was kidnappedby a lynch mob...243along with a friend and their two wives,244one of them reportedlyseven months pregnant.245The four were shot roughly60 times at close range.246Eyewitness accounts reportedthat the lynching party247included local police officers.248In the middle of whatThurgood Marshall called249that terrible season of 1946,250Isaac Woodard walked intothe New York City offices251of N.A.A.C.P. head Walter White.252The 27yearold South Carolinanative struck White253as polite and handsome,254with the ramrod straight bearingof a soldier.255I saw you, Mr. White,256when you visited my outfitin the Pacific, he said.257I could see then.258Woodard then sat down andtold the story of his blinding259in a sworn affidavit.260The policeman asked me, was I discharged?261And when I said yes,262thats when he started beatingme with a billy,263hitting me across the top of the head.264After that, I grabbed his billy,and wrung it out of his hands.265Another policeman came upand threw his gun on me,266told me to drop the billy or hed drop me,267so I dropped the billy.268He knocked me unconscious.269He hollered, Get up!270When I started to get up,he started punching me271in the eyes with the end of his billy.272N.A.A.C.P. officials,they were moved by this,273like everyone was movedby just the tragedy of it.274In addition, the N.A.A.C.P.leadership was always275on the lookout for cases of injustice276that they could useto really dramatize the nature277of the Southern racial system...278for African Americans around the country,279to get them to supportthe N.A.A.C.P.s work,280and for white peopleto make them understand281whats really going on.282Once Walter Whitegets a hold of Isaac Woodards story,283he is on fire.284He is looking for waysto publicize this story285and hes looking forthe biggest platform out there.286How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?287This is Orson Welles.288White and his new press agent reached out289to one of the nations great dramatists,290the boy wonder of stage and cinema,29131yearold Orson Welles.292In the summer of 1946,Welles was hosting a radio show293that broadcast nationally every Sunday.294The N.A.A.C.P. goes to him295and says, We need your helpto share this story.296The story fascinated him,297particularly the whodunnit quality.298No one knew who this police officer was.299Now it seems theofficer of the law who blinded300the young Negro boy in theaffidavit has not been named.301Till we know more about him, for just now,302well call the policeman Officer X.303Officer X, Im talking to you.304We invite you to luxuriatein secrecy, it will be brief.305Youre going to be uncovered!306Welles came backto the Woodard story the next week,307and the week after, drawing morelisteners each episode.308But there were holes in the story.309Three weeks into the radio broadcasts,310there were still no real leadsabout Woodards assailant,311or even about the townwhere Woodard had been pulled312from the bus.313The N.A.A.C.P. legal teamwas getting nervous.314Marshall says,We gotta get this right.315Weve got our friendsout on a limb on this thing.316Orson Welles hiresprivate investigators to go317throughout the bus route tofigure out where this happened.318And the N.A.A.C.P.snational office has its lawyers319searching these communities320asking does anyone know this story.321Arriving in, unsolicited,in the national office322is a letter from a Black soldier who says,323I heard on the radio about theblinding of Sergeant Woodard.324I was on the bus.325It was Batesburg.326I have before me wiresand press releases to the effect327that a policeman of Batesburg,328a man by the name of Shull,has admitted that he was329the police officerwho blinded Isaac Woodard.330Officer X, we know your name now.331Now that we found you out,well never lose you.332You cant get rid of me.333We have an appointment.334The Welles broadcasthad put the story in the headlines,335and a whirlwind began to swirlaround Isaac Woodard.336When word got out that the Armyhad denied the young sergeant337full disability benefits...338on the grounds that he wasblinded a few hours339after his discharge...340luminaries from New YorksBlack community organized341a benefit concert on his behalf.342Headlined by some of the biggestnames in music,343stars from Billie Hollidayto Woody Guthrie turned up344at Lewisohn Stadium in Harlem toraise money for the blind G.I.345Heavyweight champion Joe Louis,hero of Black America,346stepped forward to cochair the event.347Joe Louis sent alimousine to our house in the Bronx.348I was 11 years old.349That excited me.350Seated beside his mother, Isaac Woodard,351a young man from tinyWinnsboro, South Carolina,352was awestruck to learnthat nearly 20,000 people353had gathered in his honor.35410,000 more were turned away.355The crowd had been drawnby the allstar performances,356but it was Woodard himself whoturned out to be the headliner.357One reporter noted that applauselasted for five minutes358after he took the stage.359He spoke in a verylow voice and people had to go be360completely silent to hear him,361but it was a powerful accountof what happened.362I spent threeandahalfyears in service of my country363and thought I would be treatedas a man when I returned364to civilian life,365but I was mistaken.366If the loss of my sightwill make people in America367get together to prevent what happened to me368from ever happening againto any other person,369I would be glad.370The benefit concert nettedmore than 10,000 for Isaac Woodard...371enough to buy a house, but little else.372One N.A.A.C.P. staffer noted373though Woodard was riding high now,374in ten years no onewill remember his name.375The N.A.A.C.P. basicallyadopts a plan to make Isaac Woodard376the centerpiece of a campaignfor the promotion377of the civil rightsof all returning veterans.378He goes on a multicitynationwide speaking tour379that gathers huge crowdsall across the country.380Its hard to imaginehow many other Black men381would have been as well knownin America in 1946 and 1947382than Isaac Woodard.383So many victims ofSouthern violence are not alive.384Their bulletridden corpsesare in a grave somewhere,385but hes alive to talk about his story.386My dad told me he rememberswhen the mailman would arrive daily,387he would have a huge duffel bagthat he would carry388and the letters would justpour out onto the floor.389How does Isaac Woodardnegotiate this new world that hes in?390Hes blinded, hes got to figureout how to support himself391and also being called upon to be a symbol,392where he didnt want to be a symbol.393He just was expecting to bedischarged from the Army394and go back to his family.395The blind soldierfought for me in this war.396The least I can do now is fight for him.397I have eyes.He hasnt.398I was born a white man.399And until a colored manis a full citizen, like me,400I havent the leisure to enjoythe freedom that colored man401risked his life to maintain for me.402I dont own what I have untilhe owns an equal share of it.403Until somebody beats me and blinds me,404I am in his debt.405The Welles broadcastgenerated huge attention.406The N.A.A.C.P. built on thatand civil rights groups407around the country were writingletters demanding408for the prosecution of this police officer409for the beating and blindingof Sergeant Woodard.410In terms ofgetting justice for Isaac Woodard,411its going to be extremelydifficult, if not impossible.412There are noprosecutions of white police officers413by the federal governmentfor excessive force.414Theyre getting 1,000 to 2,000complaints a year,415and theyre essentially not doing much.416Everybody understoodthat Southern state governments417did not protect against violence.418In fact, local officials wereoften the purveyors of violence.419So, thered been calls and calls and calls420on the federal governmentto take some kind of action.421But the Department of Justicehad largely been422unwilling to step up to that task.423The Justice Departmenthad endless explanations424about why it simplywasnt possible to do this.425You had all white juries,all white grand juries.426Why are they all white?427Because African Americansare disenfranchised.428And getting a convictionagainst a white police officer429is not realistic.430Its not going to happen in the South.431Theres this part of itthat is about treating the South432as though it is some peculiar,unique, hothouse flower433that has to be handled carefully.434And that, that, that you kind ofdidnt try to interfere435with something that was regardedas kind of cultural.436And this really comes out ofthe idea that Southern mores437were sufficiently different,that it would do you no good438to try to interfere with them.439What the N.A.A.C.P. can do440is try to channel righteous outrage,441try to shine a light on thisincredibly heinous incident442and perhaps go above the headof local law enforcement443to Washington to prick theconscience of the president.444And that, perhaps, throughthe powers of the presidency,445some change can come to the South.446Thered been along tradition of Black leaders447meeting with presidentsof the United States.448But theres a lot of suspicion of Truman.449You know, how liberal is he?450How sympathetic to theN.A.A.C.P. is he going to be?451Nothing in Trumans backgroundwould lead one to believe452that he would act differentlythan the presidents before him.453Civil rights leaders hadgood reason to regard Harry Truman454as an unlikely champion of Black Americans.455He had grown up in Independence, Missouri,456a town that still celebratedits Confederate heritage.457Trumans grandparents on both sides458were rebel partisans and slaveowners.459Harry Trumansmother thought John Wilkes Booth460was an American hero.461She refused to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom462in the White House.463He grew up in ahousehold where belief in white supremacy464was simply in the air.465People used racial epithets very casually466and he continued to use themwell into his adult life.467Despite his background,President Truman was willing468to listen to the concernsof civil rights advocates.469On September 19, 1946,470Truman invited Walter Whiteand a delegation471of religious and labor leaders472for a meeting in the Oval Office.473The meeting beginsand the civil rights leaders474are asking the presidentto pass legislation475prohibiting lynching in America.476Harry Truman says to the leaders,477I understand your concerns,478but theres not the will in thiscountry for new legislation.479Walter White is listeningto this discussion.480And he realizes thatHarry Truman doesnt get it.481He stops the discussionand says, Mr. President,482I need to tell you the story ofthe blinding of Isaac Woodard.483People like HarryTruman need to be woken up.484That was part ofthe N.A.A.C.P.s job,485was to wake people up486to injustices they tolerated,487that they ignored,488that they were complicit in,and to make them see it.489Harry Truman, decadesearlier, after World War I had been490a returning veteran.491A white returning veteran, to be sure,492but the idea that a war veteran493wearing his uniformcould be pulled off a bus494and attacked and beatenby law enforcement officers,495surprised Truman and enraged him.496Truman becameredfaced, extremely agitated,497jaw clenched, and then turnsto his staff and says,498My God, I didnt knowit was as terrible as this.499We have got to do something.500The next day,the president fired off a letter501to his attorney general,referencing Isaac Woodard502and insisting it wouldrequire the inauguration503of some sort of policyto prevent such happenings.504Five days later, at Trumans insistence,505the attorney generalordered federal prosecutors506in South Carolina to initiatecriminal proceedings507against Police Chief Lynwood Shull.508This is unprecedented509for the president of the United States510to involve himselfin what white Southerners see511as a local matter.512This was a way of life for them.513They thought it was perfectlynormal for a Southern sheriff514to get away with blinding a Black man.515And so the mere fact of thefederal governments attention,516and engagement demonstrated thatsomeone was watching.517It demonstrated that perhapsthe South would not be treated518as this peculiar regionthat we wont touch.519It was very, very powerful.520President Trumansresolve to hold Chief Shull accountable521was met with predictable resistance,522even by the U.S. attorneyin charge of the case.523It is greeted in SouthCarolina with shock, anger, revulsion,524in the white political leadership.525The U.S. attorneyfor South Carolina526wanted no part of this case.527The Justice Department makes it very clear,528this is not a matter of debate,529this is an order.530You are to bring this case.531When Isaac Woodardreturned to South Carolina for the trial,532the N.A.A.C.P. dispatchedFranklin Williams,533one of their finest attorneys,to accompany him.534The N.A.A.C.P.sends Franklin Williams to travel535with Isaac Woodard for several reasons536hes blind, he needed somebodyto navigate around,537and also they fundamentally dont trust538the Department of Justice.539FranklinWilliams recognizes that the object540of this entire thing was to makeit almost like a culture war.541It was going to be a Southern way of life542versus these Northern activistsand intruders trying to dictate543their way of life on the South.544Williams offeredplenty of assistance to the prosecution545at their first and only meeting,546less than 24 hoursbefore the start of the trial.547He had a list of possible witnesses,548including bus passengerswho had seen Lynnwood Shulls549first unprovoked blows to Woodards head.550He also had at the ready a report551by N.A.A.C.P. investigatorsdetailing Shulls history552of violence againstthe Black citizens in Batesburg.553But the prosecution waved him off.554On the morning of November 5, 1946,555the courtroom in Columbiawas tense and segregated.556Shulls supporters occupiedone section of the gallery,557determined to witness the repudiation558of a federal government gone too far.559A delegation of anxiousBlack college students560took up the other half,561hoping to catch the first glimmers562of a sea change in Southern justice.563A hush fell over the roomas Judge J. Waties Waring564called the trial to order.565J. Waties Waring wasan eighthgeneration Charlestonian.566His father was a Confederate veteran,567multiple generationsof his family were slaveholders.568He was no advocate for civil rights.569And he, frankly, early onwhen he got assigned this case,570he had a lot of doubtsabout the appropriateness571of the federal governmentto prosecute a police officer.572Judge Waring, like mostin South Carolinas political class,573harbored plenty of suspicions574about federal intervention in this case.575Chiefly, that President Trumanwas motivated more576by the coming midtermsthan a concern for justice.577But Warings skepticism began unraveling578as soon as Isaac Woodard rose to testify.579Hes wearing a brown suit.580He has sunglasses.581He has to be guided to the witness chair582by court personnel.583And he then beginson the direct examination584to describe what happened,585and the story is just completely credible.586Waring knows its true.587Waring is facetofacewith this man who bears on his body588the scars of Southern racism.589He cannot look away from this590walking, talking tragedy of injustice.591The crux of the case iswhether excessive and unnecessary force592was used in regard to Isaac Woodard.593The police chief claimed594I only hit him once, I dontknow how he got blinded.595But how do you crush the globesof both eyes with one strike?596The government finished presenting its case597against Shull after just an hourand 25 minutes.598The prosecutors had not calledwitnesses who had seen599the attack unfold,or presented any evidence600about Chief Shulls patternof violence against601the Black citizens of Batesburg.602As the prosecution rested,603Franklin Williams sat in the courtroom,604furiously scrawling notes.605It was going to be a difficult case to win,606but even given that,607the Department of Justice actedwith incompetence.608They failed to call key witnesses.609They let the defense lawyersexamine the jury pool610and asked them whethertheyd been members...611all these white people...612asked them whether theyd beenmembers of the N.A.A.C.P.613I mean they never asked themwhether theyd been members614of the Ku Klux Klan.615They were just sort ofincompetent from top to bottom.616Theres a reason for that.617This is not a casethat the Justice Department618wanted to bring.619And at trial, they showed thattheir heart was not in it.620Judge Waring washorrified that he was made part621of this travesty.622He sends the jury out to deliberate,623and he tells his assistantUnited States marshal,624Ill be back in a few minutes.625And the bewildered marshal says,Your Honor, you cant leave.626This jury is going to be backin five minutes.627He says, Theyre notcoming back in five minutes628because I wont be here.629He was not going to allow a juryto do a fiveminute verdict,630which he thought would just be the capstone631of a great injustice.632That part he controlled,633and he made them sit in thatroom and stew in their juices,634until he got back.635Judge Waring walks down MainStreet to the state capitol,636and when he comes back 25 minutes later,637theyre banging on that door.638Theyve been banging on it for 20 minutes639and they come out and they announce640the acquittal of Lynwood Shull.641An exhausted IsaacWoodard had already retreated642back to his hotelwhen he received the news.643He wept, then collected himself,644and stepped outside to face reporters.645Im not mad at anybody, he told them.646I just feel bad.647Thats all.648I just feel bad.649Inside the courthouse,Judge Waring hastily packed up650his briefcase and then hurriedto meet his wife, Elizabeth,651whom he found badly shaken.652She had attended the trial.653And she found654the facts of the caseastonishing, cruel, vicious.655When the jury came backand acquitted Shull,656no one noticed that she slipped657out of the back of the courtroom in tears.658She was profoundlymoved by the testimony of Isaac Woodard,659about what had happened to himat the hands of Chief Shull.660She said she had never seen,never appreciated,661never understood that thesesorts of things could happen.662Elizabeth Avery Waringwas from a welltodo family in Michigan663and had only come South late in life.664Like Waties, she had never paidmuch attention665to the racial caste systemin and around Charleston.666Charleston, a gracious old city,667where memories and traditionslive and thrive668in a congenial air.669Everywhere is an old time,almost an old world,670charm and quaintness.671And everywhere, of course, the Negroes.672The real Negro quartersin Charleston may not boast673classic colonial architecturein all its flower,674but it has a quaintness all its own.675The Southern systemof segregation wasnt just676some benign system that677whites and Blacks acceded toand everybody was happy.678It was a violent system.679It was based on violence.680If you got out of line,681there was violent repression,682and Woodard exemplified that.683You know, for someone like Waring,684hed spent his whole life ignoring that.685I couldnt take it,at first, Waring would later admit.686I used to say it couldnt be true.687You grow up in itand the moss gets in your eyes.688You learn to rationalize awaythe evil and filth689and you see magnolias instead.690There is a willful blindness, frankly,691among most white peopleabout the truth of racism692and white supremacy in this country.693There is some ignorance because, of course,694we live very segregated lives,695but its right to say how couldhe possibly not have known?696He could not have known because697to be a comfortable middleclasswhite person in this country698generally involvesrefusing to see what is hiding699in plain sight.700The trial shatteredtheir illusion about the benign nature701of Southern life.702And, once shattered, where do they go?703There was just no tolerancein Southern society of that day,704to any honest discussion about race.705Any questioning of Jim Crow wasviewed by the segregationists706as an existential threat.707There was no course on this.708They certainly didnt know ofanyone in Charleston709that could help them better understand,710so the two of them begin a series of study711on race relations in the South.712They take in booksevery night, they read them,713and then they have sessionsafter dinner where they ask714each other questions, and they basically715create their own personal seminar to try716to understand racism in America.717The Warings startedwith two groundbreaking new works718that examined the origins andthe impact of white supremacy719in the South W.J. Cashs book,The Mind of the South,720and Gunnar MyrdalsAn American Dilemma.721Both books destroyed the comforting story722white Southerners liked to tell themselves723that slavery and Jim Crow had always been724paternal institutions725and that the Negro had longlived under the protections726of a benevolent master race.727Both made plain that whitemoderates, like Waring himself,728were complicit in this racist,violent system.729These are importantbooks, theyre complicated books,730theyre challenging books.731Judge Waring described themas tough medicine for him.732They rode through different neighborhoods733and began to see the different ways734that white Charlestoniansand Black Charlestonians735experienced life in the city.736As they began to read,737and understand, and question738all that theyve thought aboutrace in the past,739it becomes clear to both of themthat the road ahead740is going to be a rocky road,741but that this just may be the road742that they are uniquely prepared to follow.743Looking askance at Charlestonsociety wasnt such a great leap744for either of the Warings,745who had been increasinglyfeeling like outsiders746in their own hometown.747Just the previous year,Judge Waring had scandalized748his friends and neighborsby abruptly announcing749to his first wife, Annie,that hed fallen in love750with their bridge partner, Elizabeth.751Divorce was not onlyfrowned upon in South Carolina752it was illegal.753But Waring devised a planto send Annie to Florida,754where she could legallypetition for divorce.755A week after the dissolutionof his marriage to Annie,756Waties and Elizabeth were wed.757Their friends in Charleston...758were talking abouta couple hundred people,759the sort of social set in Charleston...760they blame Elizabethfor the breakup of the marriage.761Elizabeth, aNortherner now on her third marriage,762was an easy targetfor Charlestons society dames,763who branded her a floozieand told their children,764You may be polite if the newMrs. Waring speaks to you,765but never address her.766The judge noted that evenhis oldest friends767crossed the street to avoid him.768They clearlywere surprised by their treatment769because they both had beenvery engaged in the social life770in Charleston.771And having been read out ofCharlestons high society,772he was prepared to lookmore critically at the world773in which he had previously livedand accepted unquestionably.774By the end of 1946,775a racial reckoning in theUnited States seemed inevitable.776Like the Warings,President Harry Truman felt777called to respond to theblinding of Isaac Woodard778and the mockery it made of the principles779America had just defendedin a long and brutal war.780But political forces had leftTruman with limited power781to take action against white supremacy.782On the same day Woodardsassailant walked free,783November 5, 1946,784the president absorbeda stunning repudiation785at the polls.786Democrats lost both the Houseand the Senate787for the first time in a generation.788Forcing the question ofcivil rights, Truman understood,789was likely to weaken the party further.790Harry Trumanhas to deal with political realities,791and the realities arethat the Democratic Party792is an unwieldy coalition793including white Southerners,who are staunchly segregationist794and supporters of white supremacy,795and this new and growing groupof AfricanAmerican voters.796Truman knows that any movethat he makes on civil rights,797he risks alienatingSouthern white Democrats.798But at this moment,799when he sees a representativeof the United States,800a soldier in uniform,Isaac Woodard, who is maimed...801it sounds simplistic, but I think something802just kind of clicks in him,that this simply cannot stand.803We hold ourselves upas the beacon of democracy.804We hold ourselves up as moral leaders.805Moral leaders do not blindtheir own servicemen.806On December 5, 1946,807one month after the acquittalof Isaac Woodards attacker,808Harry Truman signedan executive order establishing809the Presidents Committee on Civil Rights.810The president charged his newcommittee with laying bare811hard truths about theintimidation and violence used812to enforce racial segregation,813and with recommending concretemeasures to safeguard814the rights of every American,815regardless of race, creed, or religion.816Harry Truman is a politician,817and political considerationsare never far from818the ambit of a politicians decisions.819But there were certain actionshe took which could not be820explained on the basisof political advantage.821He appointed the PresidentsCommittee on Civil Rights,822I think, probably more for moralreasons than anything else.823He saw injustice.824He was outraged by it.825He thought that he should do something.826And given Trumans background,it undoubtedly was a surprise827to civil rights advocates.828Truman said manythings that were absolutely racist829and indefensible.830They were what we would considerof the time for a white man831from Missouri.832But Truman saw no contradictionbetween these personal views833and what he saw asAmericas legal obligations834to its citizens.835That it does not matterwhat you personally feel,836whom you would have to your homefor dinner,837or whom you would havea glass of bourbon with838at the end of the day.839What matters is thatthese people have rights840under the constitution841because this isthe United States of America.842 iLift every voice and singi 843 iLift every voice and singi 844On a brutally hot,humid day at the end of June 1947,845an audience of 10,000...many of them African American...846gathered on the Capitol Mallin a state of high anticipation.847Harry Truman was about to do848what no United States presidenthad ever done.849He had accepted an invitationfrom Walter White850to address the annual conventionof the N.A.A.C.P.851at the base of the Lincoln Memorial.852The N.A.A.C.P.was considered a radical organization.853Some Southern politicians considered it854a Communist front organization.855I mean, if you were a member856of the N.A.A.C.P. in the Southand you were a school teacher,857you were probably going to get fired.858And to have Harry Trumango in front and speak859to the N.A.A.C.P.was a remarkable moment.860He had multiple drafts of the speech done.861He was editing it himself,862and he wrote a letterto his sister, and he says,863Im getting ready to give a speech864that Mama isnt going to like.865Mrs. Roosevelt,866Senator Morris,867distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,868I should like to talk to you briefly869about civil rights and human freedom.870It is more important today871than ever before to ensure872that all Americans enjoy these rights.873When I say all Americans,I mean all Americans.874The theme can be summed up in two words875that Truman used several timesin the speech,876which was only 12 minutes long.877And those two words areall Americans.878He kept repeating the phraseall Americans.879There is no justifiable reasonfor discrimination880because of ancestry,or religion, or race, or color.881We cannot any longer awaitthe growth of a will to action882in the slowest stateor the most backward community.883Our national government must show the way.884It was a stunning speech.885And when he sat down, WalterWhite, sitting next to him,886is in disbelief.887And he said,Mr. President, I just...888I cant believewhat you just said.889And he said, Walter,I meant every word of it.890Judge J. Waties Waringhad become increasingly convinced891that a bitter fight over racismwas coming to South Carolina.892He would later remember that hewas faced with two choices893Either you were going to be governed by894the white supremacy doctrineand just shut your eyes895and bowl this thing through,896or you were going to be a federal judge897and decide the law...that was the issue.898A judgedoesnt normally go and pick his cases,899but Judge Waring tells his clerk,900Keep an eye openfor new civil rights cases.901Let me know when they haveoccurred.902That evening, Waties told Elizabeth about903an explosive new case he was considering904for his trial docket.905The case, Elmore v. Rice,906had originated when George Elmore,907a prosperous Black businessman,908had been told by theSouth Carolina Democratic Party909that he was ineligible to votein the upcoming primary.910Denying Elmore the right to votewas in direct violation911of the Supreme Courts 1944 ruling912in Smith v. Allwright, whichbanned the whitesonly primary.913When you win aSupreme Court case like that,914what is supposed to happenis everyone is supposed915to comply with the judgment of the court.916South Carolina doesnt.917The South Carolina DemocraticParty says, Well,918you know, that may be whatthe Supreme Court said919but they mustve been talking to Texas.920They couldnt have beentalking to us.921South Carolinas segregationistDemocrats adopted the strategy922of willful ignorance for a reason.923The Black population inSouth Carolina stood924at roughly 40 percent,second only to Mississippis.925And that was a lot of potential voters926who might start demanding equal rights.927So even though the Supreme Courthad left no wiggle room928in striking down the allwhite primary,929the white power structure in thestate executed a spectacular930end run around the ruling.931It repealed everylaw on the books relating to the primary932and then claimed the 14th Amendment933did not apply to the DemocraticParty of South Carolina,934because there was no state action.935This was a private club having an election.936Voting is really thelynchpin of the rest of the system.937Whites have to be in power938to control the mechanisms of the state.939To do that, they haveto suppress Black voting.940So, Elmore, for Judge Waring,941is going to involve a directchallenge to the system942of Southern repression,domination, and segregation,943unlike almost all of the casesthat came before it.944So Judge Waring said to Elizabeth,945I need to tell you Ive taken this case.946And we, up to this point,947weve been doing this kindof privately, we havent948really been discussingour views with others.949But if I rule for Mr. Elmore,950our lives will neverbe the same.951Elizabeth looked at himand said, You go for it.952Its the right thing to do.953I will be with youevery step of the way.954In June of 1947,J. Waties Waring headed back955to the same courtroom whereIsaac Woodards testimony956had so shaken himjust eight months earlier,957this time to hearElmore v. Rice.958Representing George Elmore werethe N.A.A.C.P.s top attorneys,959Thurgood Marshall and Robert Carter.960In court, attorneys forthe South Carolina Democrats961expounded their novel argument962the Democratic Party was a private club,963and enjoyed the rightto restrict its membership964as it saw fit.965The federal court had no more business966directing their electionsthan it did directing967a ladies sewing circle.968Judge Waring was not impressed.969If you are a judge, and ajudge whos now awakening970to the reality of white supremacy971and racial discrimination,as Waties Waring is,972you understand that this caseactually constitutes973an opportunity to talk about therole of the Supreme Court974in relationship to Southern states,975the way in which political poweris harnessed and controlled976as part of white supremacy,and as a way to talk about977what the power of local judges are978to stop white supremacists in the South979from carrying out their plans.980Waring issued his ruling on July 12, 1947,981just two weeks after Trumans appearance982at the national conventionof the N.A.A.C.P.983He found for Elmore, quotingdirectly from Trumans speech984We can no longer afford theluxury of a leisurely attack985upon prejudice and discrimination.986We cannot, any longer, awaitthe growth of a will to action987in the slowest stateor the most backward community.988He says its a joke.989Its a ridiculous argument.990Private clubs do not elect thepresident of the United States.991And he finished the orderwith a resounding call992for his South Carolinians.993He said, It is time994for South Carolina to rejoin the union995and to adopt the American wayof conducting elections.996There was no effort to uphold997the nobility of Southern whitesupremacy, right?998Hes calling it out for what it is.999For Judge Waring,standing as a figure alone1000in a deeply entrenched Southern community,1001it is his farewell.1002Its his farewell to the societyin which he grew up1003and it marks an articulationof his decision to go it alone1004with his wife in that community.1005TheSouthern revolt against President Truman1006reaches its climax at Birmingham,1007under the States Rights banner.1008More than 6,000 flockto the rump convention1009to select the presidential ticket.1010Thirteen Southern states are represented1011in the uproarious session,which precedes the nomination1012of Governors Thurmond of South Carolina,1013and Fielding Wright of Mississippi1014as party standard bearers.1015By the time thenext election season arrived,1016a huge swath of SouthernDemocrats had had enough1017of what they calledfederal intrusion.1018Segregationists had held swayin local politics for decades,1019and they didnt intend to be pushed around1020by the United States Supreme Court,1021or federal judgeslike J. Waties Waring,1022or even the president.1023Goodbye Harry, goodbye Harry!1024At the 1948 Democratic National Convention,1025Dixiecrats walk outover the civil rights plank1026prompted by President Trumansactions, originally,1027and Strom Thurmond runsas a presidential candidate1028on behalf of the Dixiecrats.1029In the words of John Paul Jones,We have just begun to fight!1030There arethousands of white people in attendance.1031The hall is decorated inred, white, and blue bunting.1032It is festooned with Confederate flags.1033People are holding aloftpictures of Robert E. Lee.1034Theres no question as to sort of1035the animating spirit of this group,1036which is to return the South to the past,1037to maintain the racial status quo,1038to maintain white supremacy.1039Its another effort on the partof this president1040to dominate the country by forceand to put into effect1041these uncalled for and thesedamnable proposals1042he has recommended under theguise of socalled civil rights.1043And I tell you the Americanpeople, from one side1044or the other, had better wake upand oppose such a program.1045And if they dont, the next thing will be1046a totalitarian statein these United States.1047The Dixiecrats,1048their goal is to be a spoiler,1049to deny either major party a majority1050of electoral college votes,1051thereby throwing the election1052into the House ofRepresentatives, where they can1053use their power to winconcessions on civil rights.1054Truman didnt blink, and he didnt retreat.1055Nine days after the Dixiecrat revolt,1056he gave the States Righters a little primer1057in presidential power.1058Truman signed an executive order1059desegregating the federal workforce1060and, more shockingly,1061the entirety of theUnited States Armed Forces.1062Desegregating the military is something1063that Truman could do with astroke of a pen.1064He does it because hes already seen1065the worst that Southerners aregoing to do, right?1066Theyve already staged a revolt,so why not go all in?1067A lifelong friendwrites him a letter and says, Harry,1068get off this civil rights thing.1069If you dont do it, youre goingto lose the election.1070Truman writes him a letter back1071and says,You dont know what I know.1072He then tells him the story ofthe blinding of Isaac Woodard.1073He mentions these other atrocities as well,1074and he says, If I lose theelection over this issue,1075it will have been fora good cause.1076In that way, President Trumanand Judge Waring are the same.1077Every instinct of politicalsurvival should have told1078both of them to keep their handoff the hotspot of the oven.1079Both of them went to the hotspot.1080As the 1948 primary approached,1081South Carolina Democratswere brazenly evading1082Warings decision in Elmore...1083allowing Black South Caroliniansto register to vote1084only after they signed an oath1085declaring their oppositionto racial integration.1086Waring summoned nearly a hundred officials1087of the South Carolina Democratic Party1088and ordered them to register Black citizens1089without swearing any oath.1090He tells them that a federal judge1091faced with contempt has two choices.1092He can impose a fine or a prison sentence.1093He says, If you violate my order again,1094there will be no fines.1095The message that he was preparedto jail white men1096for depriving African Americansthe right to vote1097hit the white establishmentlike a thunderbolt.1098Threatening lettersbegan arriving at the courthouse1099and at Judge Warings home soon after.1100Obscene calls came intohis phone line so frequently1101that he was forced to disconnecthis service.1102White Southerners, as much as they despise1103African Americans and despise civil rights,1104they often level the most venomagainst people1105they think are traitors,and that would be Waring.1106The Warings lived their lives more and more1107on their own terms.1108Neighbors were particularly scandalized1109by the unlikely visitorsthat were seen calling1110at 61 Meeting Street.1111They became friendly with a number1112of AfricanAmerican activists.1113Septima Clark, who was a fieryadvocate for civil rights,1114was very close with the Warings,1115was a frequent visitorin the house at a time1116that Black people only entered1117the homes of white peoplethrough the back door as maids.1118Ruby Cornwell was the matriarchof the civil rights community1119in Charleston.1120She was a frequent visitorand a close friend.1121But perhaps the most interestingrelationship1122that Judge Waring develops1123is a close, personalrelationship with Walter White...1124then the most important civilrights leader in America.1125The Warings just got to the point,1126they didnt care what other people thought.1127Theres a very famous photographof the Warings,1128featured in Colliers magazine,1129that showed a dinner partyat the Warings house.1130The article was titled,The Lonesomest Man in Town,1131but he didnt look that lonesome.1132He had lots of friends at his dinner table.1133The only notable part was theywere all African American.1134Theyre socializing, theyre laughing,1135theyre enjoying each othersfriendship as equals,1136and that was terrifyingto white Charlestonians.1137Elizabeths willingnessto flout the social conventions1138of Charleston society and hercandor about Southern racism1139brought unprecedented national attention1140to the wife of a sitting federal judge.1141She found her voice.1142And she put white Charlestonians1143on notice that that was goingto be a voice that1144she would not hesitate to use.1145She was invited,1146one of the first women,to come on Meet the Press.1147Tonight from Washington,D.C., this is J. Waties Waring1148of Charleston, South Carolina,1149wife of federal Judge Waringwho stirred up a hornets nest1150in the South by her vigorousattack on white supremacy.1151Mrs. Waring, you charged in your speech1152before the YWCA group in Charleston1153that the whites down here are a sick,1154confused, and decadent people,1155and that like all decadentpeople, they are full of pride1156and complacency, introverted,morally weak, and low.1157What brought you to thisdrastic conclusion?1158Living there and observing them,1159a very deep study of the subject.1160Any people who enslave the mindsand bodies of another people1161are bound to destroy their own souls.1162In ordinary circumstances,1163the spouse of a judge wouldnot do what she did.1164But given the depth of the problem,1165the importance that somebody speak out,1166she felt as though she should.1167Are you crusadingonly for the Negros civil rights,1168such as the freedom to vote,freedom of safety of his person,1169and freedom from lynching,and so forth, or are you1170for social integration,is that what you want, too?1171I want the whole thing...I want him to go through the same door,1172and so does the judge... I wanthim to be an equal citizen.1173Reaction in SouthCarolina was swift and predictable.1174State legislators appropriated 10,0001175to fund impeachment of the judge,1176then resolved to purchase railroad tickets1177for the Warings, anywhere they desired,1178as long as it was out of thestate with no return.1179Two men were seen burning aKu Klux Klan cross1180in the Warings back garden.1181And on a quiet evening,1182while the Warings were home playing canasta1183in their drawing room, three shots rang out1184in front of their home.1185Their home is right on the street1186and theyre inside1187and suddenly two big brickscome through the window.1188They dont know if people arecoming through the window1189and through the doors next.1190But theyre petrified.1191They retreat to their dining room1192where theyre hiding behind a wall,1193believing that they are under fire.1194And within days, theUnited States Attorney General1195provided 24hourU.S. Marshal protection...1196literally, marshals sleeping outin front of his house...1197throughout the rest of his service1198as a United States district judge.1199No federal judge had ever facedsuch an attack.1200The judge, 70years old and under constant siege,1201understood his days on the benchwere numbered.1202He confided in Elizabeth1203that he meant to do onebig thing before he retired.1204With her support, he fixed his sights1205on destroying the precedent thathad underpinned legalized racism1206in the South for more than 50 years1207the strange doctrine ofseparate but equal.1208They are disgusted by the people1209who have been their friendsand who have sat idly by1210and benefited from this oppressive system.1211And they simply cant take it anymore.1212And he is now in this position1213where he can do something about it.1214What the record now shows us,1215at the time in which the mostintense pressure1216was being put on Judge Waring,1217he was making the plans of whatwould become1218the Briggs v. Elliott dissent...the case that changes America.1219This is South Carolina...1220Summerton, South Carolina...1221a country crossroads in the rich soil,1222isolated in time and space,1223and given to old ways...but not always uncritically.1224Here, perhaps more thanelsewhere in the United States,1225the racial patterns, the social patterns,1226the economic patternsare all the same pattern.1227Briggs v. Elliott...1228the case that would set in motion1229the demise of legalized segregation...1230grew from the unlikeliest soilin the nation.1231Clarendon County, just 90odd miles1232from where Isaac Woodard had been beaten,1233was a place well known to Judge Waring.1234Its in what we call the Low Country,1235he said of Clarendon.1236Swamp lands and rivers.1237One of the most backwardcounties of the state.1238The Negro schools were justtumbledown, dirty shacks1239with horrible outdoortoilet facilities.1240I lived in Summertonand I cursed the day I was born1241and had to live there.1242And I vowed that when I got grown,1243Id never see that damn place again.1244They havetalked about us as being subhuman.1245I guess from generation to generation,1246they couldnt accept the factthat Im human just like them,1247just like them.1248Most of the schools1249operated for three to fourmonths out of the year.1250And the reason for that was1251these kids need to be in, in the fields1252plowing cotton, or whatever.1253So we cant haveschool when they need to work1254to get our cotton out of the fields.1255Some of the kids in my class didnt show up1256till around Thanksgiving.1257Instead of being in school,1258they was out working the farm.1259Come early April, these kidsare out of the school,1260going back to the farm to work.1261And the system really didnt care.1262It was not meant for us asBlack folks, but two things1263go in somebodys kitchen,or go in somebodys fields.1264That happened to usa hundred years or more.1265Thats what was geared for us to do.1266They didnt expect no more from you.1267In 1947, local parents in Clarendon County1268decided to do something about the problem1269of simply getting their children to school.1270There was a fleet of buses1271for the white children in the county...1272None for the Black children.1273Some of theBlack children in their community1274have to walk nine miles to school.1275They have to ford a river.1276A group ofSummerton parents were able to raise1277several hundred dollarsto buy a used school bus,1278but the bus broke down constantly.1279So the parents turnedto the Reverend J.A. DeLaine,1280a principal and ministerwith ties to the N.A.A.C.P.1281He suggested, Wellgo in and well talk to the superintendent1282of schools about getting fundsfor gas money, repair the bus,1283and pay a salaryto who drives the bus.1284It was turned down.1285Aint got no moneyfor you niggers.1286Literally, is what they...what he was told.1287It was told that Blackfolks didnt pay enough taxes.1288You couldnt even vote.1289So there was no Black folks onthe school board to direct1290and to address the issues that was at hand.1291So what power do you have?1292My father thensaid, Well, you know, lets file a suit.1293I want to talk with Thurgood Marshall.1294Thurgood Marshall, the 40yearold chief1295of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal DefenseFund,1296reluctantly answered the summonsfrom Clarendon County.1297All through the 1940s, Marshallhad been making these trips1298from New York into the heartof the Jim Crow South.1299He had been belittled by judgesand opposing counsel1300who didnt think he could be an attorney,1301threatened with violence,and nearly lynched.1302White Americanswho want to maintain segregation1303recognize that Thurgood Marshalland his legal team are becoming1304very effective at chippingaway at that status quo.1305And that is why his life is indanger whenever he travels,1306particularly when he travels in the South.1307They would have to move him1308around from house to house at night1309during a trial because the Klanwas after him,1310and they didnt want these Night Riders1311to find out where Marshall was.1312He was threatened constantly,his life was always in danger...1313and he was terrified, too.1314But he also knew that it was important1315for the African American communities1316in those Jim Crow balconies1317to look down and see an African American1318who was not a defendant, who was in a suit,1319who was arguing the law with white men.1320It was often an electric experience1321for local African Americancommunities to see1322Thurgood Marshall come to townbecause he would do something1323that nobody had ever seen before,1324which was to address whitepeople and to make them answer1325and state reasons for what they were doing,1326and to sometimes call them liars.1327Marshall leveled with the Reverend DeLaine1328and the parents of Clarendon County.1329If the N.A.A.C.P. was going totake on their case,1330it was going to be about morethan a school bus.1331He wanted to sue for totalequality with the white schools.1332Facilities, teacher salaries,textbooks, buses...1333every resource the white schools had,1334they would demand in equalmeasure for the Black schools.1335Marshall explained he wouldnteven consider taking the case1336until he had 20 reliable,credible plaintiffs,1337people who would not cower inthe face of certain intimidation1338from the white supremacistswho ruled Clarendon County.1339More than 20 Black citizensagreed to sign on.1340On November 17, 1950,1341Thurgood Marshall hurried alongCharlestons1342palmettolined streets for apretrial hearing1343with Judge Waring,1344unaware that the judge had beenclosely following1345events in Summerton.1346Neither man harbored any doubts1347about the strength of Marshalls case1348The N.A.A.C.P. was clearlypoised to win equal facilities1349for the Black children of Clarendon County.1350The schools for whitechildren were generally the best schools1351that the tax basecould establish and support.1352The schools for Black children,1353even in some middle class school districts,1354mocked the very notion of being schools.1355They were visibly unequal to the naked eye.1356One need not even step inside1357to see how unequal they were.1358When Marshall arrives at the courthouse,1359he is told by court personnel,1360Judge Waring wants to see youin his chambers.1361Lawyers call this expartecommunication... it happened.1362Judge Waring says to Marshall,1363I dont want to try any moreequalization cases.1364Bring me a frontal challengeto segregation.1365Thurgood Marshallis absolutely floored when Waring1366essentially tells him, Look,I need you to make this case,1367get rid of segregationaltogether.1368He basically tells Marshall,1369Look, you need to gofor broke here.1370Thurgood Marshallhad dedicated much of his life1371to overturning legalized segregation.1372But he was playing the long game,1373executing a strategyhe had helped to devise137415 years earlier.1375Segregation had been sanctioned1376by an 1896 Supreme Court decision1377in a case calledPlessy v. Ferguson.1378Homer Plessy, a Black man from New Orleans,1379had challenged the segregatedaccommodations1380of Louisianas railroads and lost 81.1381Plessy v. Ferguson1382came to be seen as symbolic of the idea of1383separate but equal,1384that segregation was not unconstitutional1385as long as Blacks and whiteswere given equal facilities.1386TheN.A.A.C.P. had adopted this strategy,1387which is basically turningPlessy v. Ferguson on its head.1388Its a kind of sailing west to arrive east.1389Rather than argue against thescourge of Plessy,1390they argued for the fulfillmentof Plessy...1391that the constitutionis not being satisfied,1392not because the facilities are segregated,1393but because theyre unequal.1394They were winning cases,1395but the strategy had controversybecause every time1396you use Plessy to support your theory,1397you were driving another nail1398into the inferior legal statusof African Americans.1399The question that faced Marshall was,1400when do we move away from theequalization strategy1401and begin to argue that separate but equal1402is unconstitutional?1403And Marshall was rightlycautious about when and where1404to make that claim,1405because if he chose the wrong case1406and it went to the Supreme Court,1407the worst thing that couldhappen for Black Americans1408across the country would be forthe Supreme Court1409to ratify Plessy v. Ferguson...to confirm it in a new age1410and say, Yes, this is stillthe law of the land1411and it satisfies theconstitution.1412What Judge Waringwas pushing him to do was very risky.1413If you launched a concertedeffort to overturn Plessy1414and failed, your years of allthat work would have been thrown1415on the trash heap of history.1416Thurgood Marshall says,Judge, its on our agenda.1417Its just not tonight,this is not the time.1418This is not the place. 1419What he wasnt saying explicitly was,1420this is the last place inthe world were going to try1421to desegregate the schools.1422This is down the end of theroad, not the beginning.1423Judge Waring said, This is the time.1424This is the case.1425Youre gonna be challengingthe constitutionality1426of a state law.1427Youre going to lose,1428but youll plant the casedirectly and automatically1429onto the docket of the U.S.Supreme Court.1430And he said, Thurgood,thats where you want to be.1431At Waringsurging, Marshall petitioned the court1432to dismiss the current caseand bring a new suit,1433one alleging that segregation1434in South Carolinas publicschools was unconstitutional.1435Marshall and his team spent thenext month preparing to refile.1436But they also needed approval1437from the plaintiffs to move ahead.1438Marshall was alwaysvery powerfully conscious1439of the risks being taken by plaintiffs.1440And if you knew anything aboutClarendon County in that period,1441you knew that the Briggsand others who stood up1442to the system in thatjurisdiction were going1443to have hell to pay.1444The week before Christmas, 1950,1445dozens of parents, students,and teachers filed into1446St. Mark A.M.E. Churchin Summerton,1447ready to hear an update on theircase from Robert Carter,1448Marshalls key deputy.1449The place was packed to the rafters.1450Mr. Carter explained that1451the N.A.A.C.P. thought it wastime to attack segregation,1452root and branch,1453but that anyone who was aplaintiff in the case1454needed to understand they couldexperience severe retaliation.1455He said, Mr. Marshallwants you to know that.1456You can withdraw.1457That was made clear to the petitioners...1458if you think youre experiencingretribution now,1459if this case come from here,1460theres gonna probably be morereprisals that will come1461and dont know what form it would take.1462This was no greatrevelation to the Reverend DeLaine,1463or to the Navy veteran Harry Briggs,1464whose name was on the legal filing1465simply because he was first upin the alphabet.1466Or to any of the other petitioners1467who had signed onto the original lawsuit.1468What Marshall had warned aboutnearly two years earlier1469had come to pass.1470Did your husband sign this petition?1471Yes, he did sign the petition.1472What happened to him after that?1473Right after he signed thepetition, he told him that,1474unless he take his name off it,he would lose his job.1475On Christmas Eve,they gave him a carton of cigarettes1476and said we got somebody to replace you.1477Then money dries up.1478Couldnt get work.1479He took a pseudonym to get paid.1480Because they wasnt gonna hireHarry Briggs in the county.1481What did you tell him?1482Well, I told I him we was...we only doing it1483for the betterment of the children.1484Mmhmm. Not only our children,1485but all of the children.1486There were a lot of evictions.1487My father was threatened.1488The Black men in town had formedthemselves into a cadre1489guarding our house at night with guns.1490Reverend Delaine, he had his home burned,1491with volunteer firemen standing out front1492refusing to provide service.1493They did that to send a message, you know.1494And when his house caughton fire, we thought1495ours would be next.1496They have children, they have families.1497They have responsibilities,1498and they have to think about all that.1499You know, If I lose my farm,what happens next?1500Maybe, Ill be killed.1501And also, maybe,1502Im also the breadwinner of my family.1503Its not just that Im going to be killed,1504my family is going to bedestitute.1505Now here was RobertCarter, who didnt have to stay behind1506and live in Clarendon County...1507asking these parents to be thefirst wave of a frontal attack1508on the most jagged ramparts of segregation.1509There was a pregnant silence1510when Carter finished his presentation.1511And thenan old man in the back of the church1512raised his hand and he said, Wewondered how long it would take1513you lawyers to get there.1514They were ready.1515When you had enough, you just had enough.1516I mean, you just cant take it anymore.1517Where can you go?You cant back up.1518You just cant, you gotta go forward.1519And that was their mindset.1520Not any of those families backed down.1521Clarendon County isalmost like the Isaac Woodard case.1522The starkness of the facts,the depth of the racism1523goes to the very heart of the unfairness1524and the ugliness of white supremacy.1525And in that case for Marshall,1526its going right into the eye of the storm.1527Marshall didntexpect to win Briggs v. Elliott1528in the federal court of South Carolina.1529But his team did need to builda record of evidence,1530one that would give the UnitedStates Supreme Court1531a solid rationale for endingsegregation in public schools...1532and essentially burying its ownseparate but equal precedent.1533Marshall has to show, well,1534no matter what you did with resources,1535just the mere fact of a statute1536that requires segregationis unconstitutional.1537Why is it unconstitutional?1538Well, for us, it would be easy.1539This is just subordination of Black people.1540But for them, it was hard because1541they didnt question it.1542They werent thinking that segregation1543was harmful to Black people.1544He said, if you werein an automobile accident,1545I would have to showhow the accident injured you.1546Here in this case,1547he has to show how segregationhas injured his clients.1548What harm has it caused?1549Enter 37yearold psychologistKenneth Clark1550and his nowfamous dolls.1551Kenneth and MamieClark... the first Black Americans1552to earn PhDs in psychologyfrom Columbia University...1553had recently begun conductinga series of research experiments1554to determine the effect ofsegregation on Black children.1555The tools of the Clarks experimental trade1556were breathtakingly simple1557a suitcase full of dolls,1558four of them gender neutral,1559identical in every way exceptfor skin color.1560Two were white, and two were brown.1561Doctor Kenneth Clark explainedtheir extraordinary findings1562to N.A.A.C.P. attorneyRobert Carter,1563who lobbied his colleaguesto make the Clarks research1564central to their legal strategy.1565Theres a greatdeal of debate around the table1566at Legal Defense headquartersin New York City.1567They are thinking, what are wegoing to do with1568what they callThese damn dolls?1569Marshall sits at the end of thetable, says very little,1570and just smokes, and smokes, and smokes,1571as the attorneys hash it out, hash it out,1572until finally Marshall says,I have to show injury.1573The dolls are how Im going to show1574the injury to the children.1575Were taking the dolls with usto South Carolina.1576By daybreak on May 28, 1951,1577a caravan of cars filled withparents, teachers, and children1578was well on its way fromSummerton to Charleston,1579where they were finally goingto get their day in court.1580As they pulled up to thefederal courthouse,1581the citizens of Clarendon Countywere awed to discover1582they were not the only oneswho had made the journey.1583From across the state,1584African Americans got up earlyin the morning1585and drove to Charleston.1586And by the time the sun rose that morning,1587they were lined upas far as the eye could see.1588Out the sidewalk, around the corner.1589And these folks stood out therein hot, hot May weather.1590You ever been to South Carolina in May?1591It is hot... sticky hot.1592Thurgood Marshall,arriving that morning for the trial,1593was amazed... he had neverseen such a crowd.1594And he turned to Robert Carter1595and said, Bob, its all over.1596Carter, you know, his young associate said,1597Thurgood, what are you talkingabout?1598He said, Theyre not scaredanymore.1599For Marshall to seethe throngs, the crowds,1600coming out for the first day of trial1601showed him that something hadshifted in the South.1602Theyre not afraid anymore tofight for their full citizenship1603and to make the statement ofhow important this is to them.1604With the courtroom packed beyond capacity1605that hot spring morning,Marshall began arguing his case1606before a panel of three federal judges,1607one of whom was Judge Waties Waring.1608He sparred with defense witnesses1609from the school districtand presented his own1610expert testimonies on theegregious disparities1611between the countys Blackand white schools.1612Marshall did not stop there.1613He proceeded to show the courtthat the damage1614to the Black children in Clarendon County1615was real and quantifiable.1616His key witnesstook the stand that afternoon.1617Dr. Kenneth Clark describedfor the court1618the doll experiments he and hiswife had conducted on hundreds1619of Black schoolchildren across the country,1620asking them to evaluate and compare1621the virtues of the black and white dolls.1622Kenneth and MamieClark conduct these studies1623over a period of months and ittraumatizes them1624to have to do this over and overagain and get1625the same answers over and over again1626from different children,1627attending different schools1628in different states.1629Without fail, the Black childrenpreferred the white doll.1630Not only does theN.A.A.C.P. have all of the information1631it needs on the brick and mortar issues,1632now they have evidence that said,1633Look, this is inherently damaging1634to Black children, right?1635And this is a stigma, and this is a damage1636from which they willnever recover.1637The trial was shorterthan anticipated... just two days.1638Marshall had given it his best shot.1639As he joined the throngsstreaming out of the courtroom,1640the three judges retiredto Warings chambers1641to discuss the case.1642The conference went just as expected.1643Neither of the other two judgeshad been persuaded1644by Marshalls arguments.1645Separate but equalwould stand in South Carolina.1646The Briggs plaintiffs had lost,1647as Marshall suspected they would, 21.1648But, as Waring had planned,1649the appeal was headed straightto the Supreme Court.1650And he meant to armthe N.A.A.C.P. attorneys1651with something for the battlein Washington1652a dissenting opinion for the ages.1653He knew he was writing for history.1654He knew this was his moment.1655And he labored for dayscarefully constructing1656and rewriting and revising overand over again this dissent.1657He wrote it with care and withprecision and with passion.1658Warings dissent is quite remarkable.1659Its a direct indictment of segregation,1660and its important to say that1661because so many peoplewere finessing the issue.1662He described the testimonyof Dr. Clark1663about the injury to Blackchildren, and he said,1664This must end, it must end now.1665Segregationis per se inequality.1666Waring set off thelast sentence in a separate paragraph,1667for effect.1668And it was, in a way, his finalword on the vicious regime1669of legalized white supremacyin the Deep South.1670Soon after he filed his dissent in Briggs,1671Waring wrote President HarryTruman with the news1672that he was stepping down fromhis federal judgeship.1673The Warings left Charleston for good,1674retiring to a small apartmentin New York City.1675Thurgood Marshall wasfundraising in Alabama1676when word reached himthat the Supreme Court1677had finally ruled on the constitutionality1678of segregation in public schools.1679It had been a long and frustrating wait1680three years since the trial inJudge Warings courtroom.1681The name Briggshad been subsumed by then.1682The N.A.A.C.P. had brought foursimilar desegregation cases,1683in Virginia, Delaware,the District of Columbia,1684and Kansas.1685The five cases had beenconsolidated and filed1686as Brown v. Board of Educationof Topeka, Kansas.1687Briggs was thefirst case to arrive at the Supreme Court.1688By all accounts it should havebeen Briggs v. Elliott.1689My personal theory is that thecourt did not want this case1690banning school segregation to befocused on a Southern case.1691Topeka, Kansas, was not in the South.1692And the South would claimit was being picked on.1693But how do you say that if thelead defendant1694is Topeka, Kansas?1695The Supreme Court hasrendered a momentous and historic decision1696saying that education shouldbe equal in this free America.1697The fact it was a unanimous decision1698should set for rest once and for all1699the problem as to whether or not1700second class citizenship, segregation,1701could be consistent any longerwith the law of the country.1702Marshall and theN.A.A.C.P. had certainly been hopeful.1703I dont think there was any reason for them1704to expect it to be unanimous.1705That must have been a surprise.1706The decision is writtenin a manner and at a length1707such that it could be printed inevery newspaper in the country.1708So that it could be read and understood1709by any literate person in theUnited States.1710So that it could be read to someone1711who might not be able to readhim or herself,1712and that person would be able to understand1713why and how the justiceshad reached this conclusion.1714Citing evidencefrom the Clarks doll studies,1715Chief Justice Earl Warren was explicit1716about the very real damagesuffered by children1717segregated by race.1718Any language inPlessy v. Ferguson contrary1719to this finding, he wrote,is rejected.1720But Warren steered clear of anymention of Waties Waring,1721who had been the only federaljudge in the five cases1722to file a dissent arguing1723that segregation itselfwas unconstitutional.1724You gotto remember at this time Judge Waring1725is a very polarizing figure.1726Hes probably the most reviledwhite man in the South1727among white Southerners.1728The court didnt make his dissent1729the basis of their decision.1730But it is obvious when you read it,1731it is Judge Warings language.1732Back in New York City,1733Walter White and other luminaries1734from New Yorks civil rightscommunity gathered1735in the Warings parlor to toast1736the historic milestoneand the final triumph1737of Judge Warings judicial strategy.1738A few miles away,Thurgood Marshall and his team1739held their own victory party,1740allowing themselves onlythe briefest of revelries.1741For Marshall, the Brownruling did not mark the end1742of a hardfought battle,but the beginning of a new one.1743Everyone was celebrating in the office1744and Marshall said Youre alla bunch of fools, you know,1745We have a lot more work ahead, okay?1746We have to get back to work.1747He understood what was to come.1748As a leader, you can barelyexperience excitement1749without looking around thecorner for whatever1750is the next challengeor work that has to be done.1751Hello, welcome to Like It Is.1752Todays edition featuresa look back in time1753into the tragedy of Isaac Woodard,1754a man whose confrontation withSouthern racism1755came to symbolize the brutality in America1756at the end of World War II.1757Nearly 40 yearsafter his blinding, Isaac Woodard agreed1758to revisit the details of his ordeal1759with a local television journalist.1760Do you think back towards those days,1761to have something like this happen to you1762while youre still in uniform?1763A lot of people ask me,was I bitter with, you know,1764with the world, with everybody?1765I told them, no, I wasnt.I wasnt because...1766I said, well, everybodyaint bad, you know,1767that I know.1768And the one that Im really bitter against,1769the one that really did it to me.1770He never served a day... No, no, no.1771Kept his job. Right, right.1772Kept his job, they didnt eventake him off the force,1773you know?1774For the first few years,1775he called them namesI couldnt even mention.1776But, uh, he grew out of it.1777I saw the part of him after the bitterness,1778and the anger, and the frustration.1779Most of the time I saw him, he was smiling.1780He was so welldressed.1781There was a tie clip on the tie,1782and you could tell the way he walked,1783he was proud of who he was.1784In 1962, the U.S.Army finally granted Sergeant Woodard1785the disability benefits they had denied him1786in the years following his blinding.1787Eventually, he was able to buy1788several properties throughout the Bronx1789and provide a comfortable lifefor himself and his family.1790What do you thinkthat people should learn about,1791whats happened to Isaac Woodard,1792what lesson is there about America?1793Well, I mean, the way I feelabout it, you know,1794that people should learn howto live with one another,1795and how to treat one another.1796Because after all, we all are,were human beings,1797regardless of color.1798Everybody should, you know, havesome sympathy for one another,1799you know?1800And dont do cruel things to one another1801that you dont wanna be did to you.1802Thats the way I feel about it.1803Isaac Woodard died in 1992, at age 73,1804entirely unaware that his simple request1805to be treated like a man, andthe injustice that followed it,1806had emboldened a federal judge1807and the president of the United States1808to pursue the destructionof legalized segregation.1809Historianslike to talk in terms of grand narratives.1810But when you look closely,you find often it is1811a single person taking a certain action.1812Its not often sufficientto cause grand change,1813but it is a spark.1814Every fundamental shiftin this country has required the courage1815of ordinary people to demandthat they be respected,1816exceptional human beingswho were willing to put1817their lives on the line.1818The ways in which they changed this country1819we accept almost like air,1820without ever giving a moments thought1821to the individuals whosacrificed themselves for it.1822You dont know what the effectof your speaking up1823and using your voice will be.1824It may even look like it was nominal.1825But in the long course of history,1826can be earthshattering,and powerful and important.1827Support us and become VIP member to remove all ads from www.OpenSubtitles.org"

ending my nineyear relationship,16the 30yearold me,had nothing to offer to the world.17To change my life, the first thing I did18was move out.19What do you think?20Isnt it spacious?21Yes.22Its nice.23Im leaving.24Moving out from my family25was too simple,26and the fence keeping the family27was too loose,28so I felt even lonelier.29What is it all of a sudden?30I felt anxious all of a sudden31I couldnt stay home, so I came outside.32Maam, we will tell you inside the house.33EUNJOO34ELDEST DAUGHTER35Yes.36Is Taehyung there?37Yes.38Im almost near the house.39Tell him to wait.40I

thereon your own, like doing homework?47You said youll tell her last time.48I thought it was rude for me49to not visit her once you told her.50I couldnt tell her on that day.51It turned into a somewhatnoisy family occasion.52Im going to refrainfrom being the party pooper from now on.53When I heard you were going with Eunhee,54I did worry that would happen.55You really were a family.56You know too well.57We were family.58To my family,59youve always been a guest,60but to your family61I was their familythe moment I stepped into62that house.63Come in.64Sit comfortably.65Mother.66We67decided to get divorced.68Im sorry.69Why?70We cant be together anymore.71Our love for each other has disappeared.72You answer me.73What could bea more certain reason than that?74We cant love each otheras a man and a woman anymore.75Its meaningless to be together.76I77I know my daughter.78If you showed that much love,considering your personality,79it means you liked him very much.80Its the same now.81Coming here as a couple and sitting there.82You cant do that to someone83who doesnt love you anymore.84You.85Is there another woman?86Thats not what it is, Mom.87No.88Im sorry.89If youre sorry, tell me the reason.90I found my family uncomfortableand hated them,91so I got married to run away from them.92I got the wrong ideathat Eunjoo chose to marry me93for the same reason.94You got married95because you hated your family?96Is that97what you mean?98Eunjoo.99Is that what he means?100I still find my family uncomfortableand cant stand them.101But I learned that102Eunjoo loves and treasures her family.103I hardly knew anything104about Eunjoo.105I thought we could livetogether like friends.106I realized Eunjoo doesnt need a friend,107but someone to love instead.108I wasnt qualifiedfrom the very beginning.109Everything is my fault.110I cant make Eunjoomore miserable than she is now,111and I want her to start over,112so we decided to part ways.113I promised myself114that when I become a mother,115I will let my children live freely,116will not discriminateagainst my daughters,117and let them do whatever they want to do.118But when it became a reality119it was hard to do so.120Im sorry, Mom.121I122I will try to live my life.123You are capable,124so it wouldve been easierfor you than for me,125but seeing you two126parting ways so suddenly and vainly,127it seems like it was my fault128to mention graduation from marriage129How is it your fault?130Thanks to you131Im enduring it so well.132The child whom everyone wanted aborted,133survived so well thanks to her brave mom.134Dont you think135its a waste to see that daughterbeing forced to live a fake life?136People might think137youre 20 years old when they see you.138My precious daughter.139No one sees me like that.140Its been a few yearssince kids started calling me an old lady.141You dont look old at all.142You143Want to live with me?144Im thankful145that you accepted itmore easily than I thought,146but still, thats not right.147Eunjoo.148Your father149knows that you know.150I told him.151Good.152Would you like me153to tell him about this?154No.155Ill go see him with Eunhee.156And see how hes doing too.157Mom158just think about yourself now.159I hardly knew anything160about Eunjoo.161Yes.162We hardly knew anything163about each other.164This165Wash.166CEO.167Theres something you dontknow about Jiwoo.168What?169I saw his social mediaand something seemed weird.170You know how I get obsessivewhen Im curious.171I searched everything from social mediato game usernames and found her.172Who?173He said he was dating someoneand that she was a bit far away.174Shes his first lovefrom school or something.175Isnt that a common storyfor those who use social media?176Something feels off.177Someones first love is alwaysa target to be attacked, right?178Its not like that.179I heard she lives in Toronto,but nothing seems right.180She has more than 800 friends worldwide.181Is she the UN?182I dont like badmouthing people.183If youre curious, go ask Jiwoo yourself.184Why would I ask him?It has nothing to do with me.185I couldve crawled here faster.186The CEO there kept asking me questions,so I answered them.187He says Im the only friendly one.188He said youre exceptionally scary.189Then should I smile while Im working?190You should smile more.191When is your driving test?192Why?193Eunhee asked me.194She should just ask me if shes curious.Whats the point of asking through you?195I guess she wants to give

didnt tell us?135When Mom heard about my divorce,136she blamed herself, sayingthe graduation from marriage137caused the divorce.138Nonsense.139Then will they not tell us140if something happens141because it may burden us?142We would eventually find out,143so whats the point of making it harder?144We have to tell themto tell us everything.145The location of the tumor is bad,146so theres a high chanceof having an aftereffect.147He can lose his memories again too.148His vision may decrease,149or he may suffer from paralysis.150Im sure they heard the explanation.151We have to go see them,so dont cry too much.152Does my face look okay?153Mom, Dad, what is this?154That scared me, seriously.155Its okay.156You shouldve told us if you were sick.157Wheres Jiwoo?158The mood will

Administration.16In July 1921,noted Russian author Maxim Gorky17issued a plea to the West.18Gloomy days have comefor the country of Tolstoy,19Dostoyevsky, Mendeleev, Gorky wrote.20I ask for prompt aidto the Russian people.21Give bread and medicine.22Gorky never mentioned Vladimir Lenin23or his Bolshevik revolution.24Russia had suffered a drought,which was not unusual.25The famine of 1921 was.26It would become the worstnatural disaster in Europe27since the Black Plague in the Middle Ages.28There was this historical coincidence29of a number of social forces30the collapse of the tsarist regime,31the outbreak of civil war,32the policies of the Bolsheviks themselves.33The government carried outmass requisitioning of grain,34which prevented peasantsfrom feeding themselves35or even having enough seedto carry on next season36planting a new crop.37Herbert Hoover,the new secretary of commerce38under President Warren Harding,39spotted Gorkys plea in a newspaper.40Hoover was also the director41of the American Relief Administration,42known as the ARA.43For most Americans,44Herbert Hoover is associatedwith the Great Depression.45But back in the 1920s,46his image was one of beinga very efficient...47a hardheaded humanitarian48who knew how to get the food through.49No one in the West had better credentials50to answer Gorkys requestthan Herbert Hoover.51Hoover was a Stanfordtrainedmining engineer52who had operated in Australia, China,53and Russias Ural Mountains,54and knew the logisticsof moving men and materiel55around the world.56When World War I broke out, hewas asked to organize the relief57of an entire nation.58There were seven million Belgians59living under German occupation.60So it became Hoovers responsibility61to provide daily food assistance62that would keep all those people alive.63And Hoover showed that he hadthe administrative talents64as well as the humanitariansympathies to pull this off.65And he became an American heroand even an international hero.66After the war,67the Paris Peace Conferenceasked the United States68to feed tens of millions in 21 countries69throughout wartorn Europeand the Near East.70The U.S. created the ARAwith Herbert Hoover as its head.71It has been said, and I think correctly,72that Herbert Hoover was responsible73for saving more lives thanany person who has ever lived.74He became knownas the Master of Emergencies75and the Great Humanitarian,76the embodiment of an America77proud of its newfound sense ofitself as an altruistic nation.78Hoover accepted Russias plea for help.79Will Shafroth, 29, son ofthe governor of Colorado,80joined other famine reliefworkers from the United States81and headed for Moscow.82Spurred by a sense of adventureand altruism, Hoovers boys,83as they came to be known,84had done relief work after World War I85and represented an Americathat emerged from the war86as a world power.87Now their idealism would be tested88by a railroad system in disarray...89a forbidding climate...90a ruthless government suspiciousof their motives...91and the shear scaleof starvation and death.92They would be amongthe first Americans to see93the earthshaking revolution94that Vladimir Lenin andhis Bolsheviks had wrought95and the first to feel the tensions96that would mark U.S.Sovietrelations97for much of the century.98On September 1, 1921,99the first ship carryingAmerican relief supplies100arrived from Hamburg, Germany,101and docked at Petrograd,the former St. Petersburg.102It began to unload 700 tons ofrations that had been in storage103since the European relief.104The ARAs goal in Russia wasto do what it had done105in postwar Europe106feed children, mainly in the cities.107Feeding one million seemeda manageable task.108Within a week, the first ARAfeeding station opened109in Petrograd School number 27.110The menu was white bread,corn grits, rice, milk, cocoa,111and sugar.112At a time when therewas not a spark of hope anywhere,113unexpectedly, without any reason,114nobody could explain why Americans came,115why they provide food for children.116The Chicago Tribune began running a story117that would captivate America.118It also appealed for funds.119Private donations began to flow to the ARA.120Five days after his arrival in Moscow,121Will Shafroth was part of an ARAscouting party sent east122to evaluate the famine in the Volga valley.123People had fled their villages,desperate to escape the famine.124At the station at Kazanon the northern Volga,125Shafroth noted wretched creatures126huddled together in compactmasses like a seal colony.127Most were children whose mothershad deserted them or had died.128Shafroth and his fellow scoutsthen drove to a home129for orphaned and abandoned children130whose liceridden clotheshad to be destroyed.131I saw emaciated little skeletons,132whose gaunt faces and toothpicklegs testified to the truth133of the report that they weredying daily by the dozen.134The stench was nauseating.135He served with the ARA in Polandright after the war,136but he had never witnessedscenes of horror like this.137Shafroth witnessedthe same or worse in Simbirsk,138in Sengiley, in Samara.139Once the richest graingrowingprovince in the Volga valley,140Samara was now at the heart of the famine.141My father wrote about one childrens home142in Samara where 283 childrenwere confined to three rooms.143They were sitting on the floor,144and when I asked the bravelittle lady where they slept,145she pointed to the floor and said, There.146We have no other placefor them.147And then she had thoselittle, hungry, homeless waifs148sing for me.149My dad said he had to turn away.150It was more than he could stand.151In October1921, Colonel Walter L. Bell,152a National Guardsman from Syracuse,153was dispatched into the abyssof the unknown...154Ufa in Bashkiria, 725 miles from Moscow,155at the foot of the Ural Mountains.156His relief district would expandeast across the Urals157to the edge of Siberia.158It is impossibleto describe the suffering and misery159that presented itselfon every side.160I found the only food was made from weeds161mixed with groundup bones,tree bark, and clay.162The famine was awful.163People were eating almost everything164that could be swallowed.165They ate straw from the roof.166Using this straw and suchsubstitutes of food,167they became ill and they look168something like fat men,169but it was the beginning of their illness.170We had a camel...two camels our family had.171Finally, of course, we ate him, our family.172So we ate all cats, dogs,horses, everything.173Shafroth and Bell wired their reports174to Colonel William Haskell in Moscow,175a retired Army officer who was the director176of the ARAs Russian relief.177Haskell began to grasp theenormity of the problem.178In October 1921,he wired Hoover in Washington179that the starvation would peakin the winter180and affect 16 million people.181Hoover realized the challenge182was not hunger, as in postwar Europe.183Soviet Russia faced the greatestfamine in history.184Feeding one million childrenwould only scratch the surface.185He needed to feed adults as well.186That would mean funding from Congress.187Yet he worried Americans would be reluctant188to spend their tax dollars on people189whose Communist governmentmany saw as monstrous190and intent on spreading revolution.191We had had a Redscare in our own domestic politics192in 1919, 1920, a general strike in Seattle,193a bombing of the home194of the attorney general of theUnited States, never solved.195There were many reasons to fearthat leftwing agitation,196even of the Communist variety,was a serious menace.197Hoover had areputation not just as a humanitarian198but also as a staunch antiCommunist.199In postwar Central Europe,200he had helped thwart Leninsattempts to expand Communism201by threatening to withhold relief supplies202from countries sympatheticto the Bolsheviks.203That worried the American left.204Leftofcenterpeople... legitimately, I think...205suspected that his motivationhere wasnt pure,206because he had thiscounterrevolutionary record207with respect to food reliefin Eastern Europe.208To them, a Socialist revolutionor a Socialist regime in Russia209was an experiment that should beencouraged.210In Hoovers mind,211there was no conflictbetween feeding people...212giving sort of straightforwardhumanitarian relief213on the one hand...214and using food as a politicalweapon to stop Bolshevism.215Bolshevism was wicked.216It was evil.217Stopping it was humanitarian.218Hoover felt theexample of American efficiency219and generosity might do morethan just feed the Russians.220That was part of his pitchto President Warren Harding.221He wanted and I think implied222that food famine relief could, perhaps,223lead to a regime change224and that it might get ridof the Bolsheviks.225He thought that by bringing in226Americans with their talentsand administrative expertise...227their efficiency, if you will...228that they could serve asan example to the Russians.229Lenin was afraid that he wouldtry to sneak arms in with food230and try to organize a resistance.231No, no, Hoover was not tryingto do that at all.232Hoovers primaryargument for helping the Russians233was an economic one.234Feeding Russians would helpAmerican farmers235who were sitting on huge surpluses.236Hoover asked Congress for20 million to buy surplus corn237for an expanded relief programfor children and for adults.238Some in the House feared it would bolster239the Bolshevik government.240With unemployment reachingfive million during a recession,241some senators favored projectsthat would create jobs242for Americans or help veterans in distress.243Hoover supporters and the FarmBelt lobby carried the day.244On December 22, 1921,with Hardings backing,245Congress approved the purchaseof surplus corn.246Hoover also insistedthe Soviets buy wheat seed247to plant in the spring to securethe harvest of 1922.248The ARA campaign in Russia249would be the largest reliefoperation to date...250and the first to provide reliefto an adversary.251The challenge was to get the food252almost halfway around the world,253where up to 100,000 Russianswere dying every week.254Americas surplus corn and wheatseed began to move quickly255from the heartland to the holdsof oceangoing freighters.256The first relief ships leftNew York in midJanuary 1922,257carrying 300,000 tons of grain.258The task before the ARA workersin Russia was Herculean.259During the child feeding,260the ARA had divided Russiainto ten districts.261Each had an American supervisorand a small staff of Americans.262Once again, these relief workers set off263into the far corners of their districts,264estimating the new needs,arranging for more warehouses265to store 20 million bushels of corn266and thousands of tons of seed...267and directing the village committees268to identify starving adultsfor the expanded relief.269They traveled over the flatexpanses of the Russian steppes270for silent days in crude sleighs,271by train if they could find a private car.272Their greatest physical threatwas typhus, spread by lice.273Theyre afraidto travel with ordinary Russians274in thirdclass cars because of lice.275Theyre traveling along in a sled,276and they get out and they gointo a peasant hut277for the night and they seethe walls crawling with lice.278So they go back in the sled,they bundle up, and they know279Mr. Louse, as they called him,couldnt survive in that cold.280The ARA had to expand its staff.281With no more than 200 Americansupervisors in Russia282at any one time, it hired120,000 Russians to do the work.283They invited those who could speak284at least a little bit Englishor other foreign languages.285For ARA, it was practical reasons.286They had an education.287Because most Communists werewithout any education,288no languages, but the Russian authorities,289they interpreted thisas an opportunity for the ARA290to find people who would be able to support291counterrevolutions, all these things.292So, different perceptions.293Will Shafroths Samaradistrict was divided into eight regions,294each with at least one warehouse.295Every village had a committeeof local citizens296who decided who got fed.297Shafroth would supervise 16,000Russians in 900 kitchens.298In his sprawling Ufa Urals district,299Walter Bell faced even greater challenges.300The populationof that district was almost nine million301and the territory is bigger than France.302And there were only five or six Americans303supervising the operations.304They didnt know Russian at all.305They knew nothing aboutBashkir and Bashkiria.306They kept asking each other,307Have you ever heardabout those Bashkirs?308They, they didnt know thatsuch people exist.309The Bashkirs had been a nomadic people310who settled in what would becomeRussias lawless wild east.311In addition to the Muslim Bashkirs312who were hostile to the Russians313and had a reputation for plunder,314Bells district contained Kazakhs,315who for centuries had attacked the Bashkirs316and hated the Russians.317The diplomatic entanglementsinvolved, Bell would write,318make the Paris Peace Conference seem319like a wellconductedprivate school.320Walter Bell faced a formidable task.321Unlike Shafroth,he had no previous experience322with relief work.323Vladimir Lenin kepta watchful eye on the ARA.324In February, the Cheka...his secret police...325ordered its agents to purge theARA of undesirable elements.326These agents beganto infiltrate ARA offices,327hired as Russian assistants.328They reported to Alexander Eiduk,329a Cheka agent who wasthe Soviet governments liaison330with the ARA.331Was there anypolitical activity made by the ARA?332Did they meet any suspicious persons here?333Did they agitate against anything?334Did you notice any antiCommunist slogans335in their declarations?336Eiduk also triedto undermine the ARAs American staff.337One target was David Kinne, the29yearold district supervisor338of Saratov Province on the Volga.339Cheka agentshad secret instructions from their chiefs340to use every American weakness341to get control over American supply.342And David Kinne wasa perfect match for them343because he was an alcoholic.344The Cheka exploited Kinnes weakness.345The Soviet notionis if they can get control of the food,346they can funnel it to the peoplethey want to get the food,347and they can keep the food away from people348they dont want receiving the food.349Poretskii, that guy from Cheka350who was supervising Americanoperations in Saratov,351he knew exactly what he was doing.352The Chekaagents took over Kinnes operation353and diverted food from childrento their political allies.354It took several months beforethe ARA could reclaim355American control in Saratov province.356In March, David Kinne wasdismissed from the ARA357and sent out of Russia a broken man.358American relief ships gotas far as the Baltic Sea,359only to become icebound inFebruary and for much of March.360It was the coldest winter in 15 years.361The Lord seems to have a particular animus362toward the Russian people,an ARA staffer mused.363He cuts off the rain in the summer364and freezes up the Balticin winter.365While touring his districtin the fall of 1921,36647yearold Walter Bell contracted typhus.367His Russian assistants drove himfor three days368back to Ufa, delirious.369He was unconscious forthree weeks and almost died.370Harold Blandy, Bells assistant in Ufa,371also came down with typhus.372Harold Blandy had a big heart.373Harold Blandy was the type who could not374simply go into a childrens homeand inspect it.375He had to go into a childrens home376and interact with the children,put his hand on the kids head.377It wasnt a surprise to the Ufa Americans378that Blandy caught typhus.379Blandy died a week later.380To the Russians,his death warranted a tribute...381an elaborate funeral procession in Moscow.382To the ARA, anyone who caughttyphus, much less died from it,383was an embarrassment.384To be outwitted by lice was to fall short385of being a cautious andefficient relief worker.386When Walter Bell recovered,387he resumed his tour of someof the remotest parts388of his district.389He found a home in what hecalled the wilds of Russia.390He would stop at a villageand spend days at a time391with the local Bashkirsand Soviet officials,392including Eiduks Cheka agents.393He out thinks these people,a colleague noted,394and wins them by his courtesy.395The other directors of the ARA regions,396they were not politewith Russian authorities.397And I have read some letters.398They were full of sarcasm, irony,399and sometimes they used rather rude words.400Mr. Bell, he was polite,401and sometimes, when there were his mistake,402he accepted that he was not right.403One big reason for the friendly contact404that existed between usand the authorities405was whenever we had animportant question to decide,406we had a conferencewith the ones concerned.407Bell wasolder than most of the ARA workers.408And it was easier for local population409to perceive him as a boss.410Hes Colonel Bell.411Hes, as the Russians would say,Polkovnik Bell.412And were dealing with a country here413that has just seen a civil war,414Whites and Reds going back and forth.415Military authority counts for something.416With the Balticfrozen and supplies running low,417Polkovnik Bell told his colleagues418he was forced to putthe childrens kitchens419on half rations.420Yet he continued to feed the children421of both Russians and Bashkirswith their cooperation,422not interference.423On February 6, 1922,424the first American ship carryingcorn to feed Russian adults425docked at Novorossiysk on the Black Sea.426Six weeks had passed sinceCongress had voted.427The next link in the chainto feed the starving Russians428would be a crucial one, and the weakest.429Years of war had wrecked80 of Russias railroads.430An American journalist wrote431of locomotives resting in graveyards432silently like sleeping monsters...433of miles of sick box cars on sidings434like rows of skeletons.435The corn had traveled by shipalmost 5,500 miles in 16 days.436The trip from Novorossiysk toSamara was only 1,300 miles,437yet it would take 21 days.438The dilapidated railroads wereurged to do the impossible,439Will Shafroth wrote,and they did it.440Shafroth received a smallfirst installment of corn441in midMarch.442And actually the Bolsheviks paid443to railroad workers with American corn444to make the trains run.445And it was a big help446because Russian governmentdidnt have money447and didnt have food to pay them.448With relief workersdesperately waiting for more supplies,449entire trains began to disappear.450Shafroth wired Moscow thatlocal officials in Samara451had commandeered 95 corn carsfor railroad employees.452The authorities in Moscow had nocontrol over their railroads.453By midMarch, almost 7,000freight cars had left the ports.454At the end of the month, 60,000tons of supplies were waiting455for the empty cars to return.456Fortysix trains from Odessain Ukraine were stalled457in one yard west of the Volga.458Supplies from the Balticvia Moscow were stalled459at another train yard.460The result was like logjams on rivers.461Trains were hemmed in.462For three weeks, nothing could move.463Relief supplies from boththe Black Sea and the Baltic464to much of the Volga valley465and all of Walter BellsUfaUrals district were stalled.466An estimated 25,000 Russians467died in these regions each week...46875,000 more deaths by the end of March.469People had been dying at thisrate all over Russia all winter.470Will Shafroth describeda scene he witnessed in Samara.471I have seen piles of corpses,472half naked and frozen intothe most grotesque positions473with signs of having beenpreyed upon by wandering dogs.474I have seen these bodies475and it is a sight thatI can never forget.476Shafroth cabled Haskell in Moscow477that the body of a Russianassistant who recently died478from typhus had been dug up and eaten.479Ten butcher shops, he said,480had been closed for selling human flesh.481Americans read that Shafrothhimself had been eaten.482The governmenttried to stop people eating corpses.483And they led propaganda against this,484and they tried to put guardsin the cemeteries485in order to prevent peoplefrom eating dead bodies.486Grandma told me about it.487When the dark was coming,488they put a huge lock to save children,489because children were themain target of cannibals.490There were cases of killingchildren by their own mothers,491by their own parents, and eating them.492Some mothers did that for mercy.493But some mothers killed themto feed other children,494especially very small babies.495And now, at the end of March 1922,496dozens of trains with reliefsupplies were stalled.497It was unclear why the firsttrains were detained.498What was clear is that onlythe Russians could undo499the train jam.500Alexander Eiduk, the Russian in charge,501told Haskell everything was under control.502For two weeks, he did nothing.503Another 50,000 Russians starved to death.504If the American wheat seed werenot planted that spring,505there would be no harvest in the fall.506The famine would continue another year.507Haskell decided it was time for a showdown.508He decides to send a cable509in the clear...not coded, in the clear...510to Herbert Hoover,511meaning that the Kremlinwould be able to see512the message he was sending.513And the message was the Sovietsare not only not helping,514theyre being obstructionist,515and that until he got better cooperation,516all relief supplies from the United States517ought to be held up at port.518The engineerin Herbert Hoover had foreseen the limits519of Russias railroads.520He had testified before Congressthat 20 million worth of corn521would test these limits.522When Haskells telegram arrived,523Hoover was being blamedby his critics on the left524for exaggerating Russiastransportation problem.525He was attempting to kill theSoviet government, they argued,526by limiting relief supplies.527Hoover could have silenced these critics528by releasing Haskells telegram.529But he felt stirring upantiSoviet feelings530would be inappropriate for an agency531engaged in the businessof saving human lives.532Lenins government got the message.533It humiliated, then fired, Eiduk.534It brought in Felix Dzerzhinski,535Peoples Commissar of Transportation,536better known as the founder of the Cheka537and mastermind of the Red Terrorduring the civil war.538He was the most feared manin Soviet Russia.539It was very important symbolically.540The dreadful Iron Felix was appointed541as a railroad commissar.542And every railroad worker understood.543Its a sign.544We should do something,otherwise we will be shot.545And the trains started to run.546The corn was finally on its way.547Its distribution would be planned548in hundreds of ARA offices across Russia.549Here the Americans still facedmajor hurdles.550The culture clash was profound.551A lot of the people the Americans hired552had never really workedin an office before.553If they had worked in an office,554it wasnt like an American office.555The Americans wanted youto get to work on time.556You start work at 800.557What the Americans found was theRussians would wander in late.558Well, there was a goatfor sale up the street,559and I had to go check that out.560It would drive them nuts.561There were evenproblems with the elite they hired.562With the best will in the world,563it is rather difficult for anexprincess to do crossfiling,564wrote a relief worker from Montana.565Especially baffling to the Americans566was the sense of passivity and resignation567on the part of peasants who came for help.568Many Russianssaw in that famine a sign of...569a sort of God will, a sort of retribution570for their bad behaviorduring the revolution.571They seized church land.572They killed priests.573So we can only suffer,because we deserved it.574These Americansgot pretty impatient with this.575Their attitude was, Look,its time to get to work.576This is their Protestant ethic speaking.577Your fate is in your hands.578Get up off your knees, start to help out,579and lets get moving.580Despite theculture clash, romance flourished.581The Americans had comfortablequarters, food, and cars.582Their Russian staff was mostly women.583Of the 300 American supervisors,26... nearly ten percent...584came home with Russian brides.585Weather had helped cause the famine.586Now it once again delayed the relief.587A spring thaw made it almostimpossible to get the corn588from the railheads to the villages.589The return of winter helped.590Horses were important...591those which had not died or been eaten.592Many were too weak to draw heavyloads over long distances.593Where horsepower was lacking,some relied on camels.594The camel can live where the horse dies,595the Chicago Daily News noted.596It grubs up herbage from under the snow.597It will exist on anything.598An ARA Russian inspectorremembers seeing 2,500 wagons,599drawn mostly by camels,600leave Tsaritsyn and head for Leninsk.601In spite of the immensityof the steppes, he wrote,602it was impossible to see the beginning603or the end of this train.604Even the oldest and mostexperienced teamsters admitted605they had never seensuch a sight.606Contrary to the popular imagination,607the corn was not heralded withthe ringing of church bells,608an ARA physician wrote.609These people have borne so much610that their emotions havelong since exhausted.611He observed the only survivingmember of a family of five612clutch her 21day ration.613My father saidthat there were a half a million people614in his district who faced starvation615when he began to distribute the corn.616Every household got a monthssupply... two pounds per day.617Thats the job he cameto do, and he was doing it,618and he was very pleased.619People used to call that food America.620So, we were handed outAmerica.621At home, people cooked soup outof it, fed their children.622This, of course, was great help to us.623My father used to say, See, theAmericans did the right thing,624sent us help.625Every day in hisUfa Ural Mountains district,626Walter Bell fed 1.6 millionRussians, Bashkirs,627Tatars, and Kazakhs in 2,750 kitchens.628One was a threeyearold boy.629I still remember they gave us corn630and sweetened condensed milk.631I was little then, butI still remember the taste632of that American canned condensed milk.633Our father brought it to us.634Thanks to this help I survived,635and then studied andbecame a famous dancer.636Before the corn and wheat seed arrived,637up to five million Russianshad starved to death.638By August 1922,639five months after the cornreached the villages,640the ARA was feeding up to11 million Soviet citizens641every day in 19,000 kitchens.642Jesus Christ brought 13 people bread.643Herbert Hoover gave millionsof people bread.644You cannot find other example ofsuch behavior in world history.645Herbert Hoover hadinsisted the Russians buy wheat seed,646which the peasants plantedin the spring of 1922.647The wheat harvested that fall648ensured the famine would not return.649The starvation in the Volgavalley was finally over.650Whether the Russiansor anyone else realizes it,651the ARAs historian wrote,652we have saved a nation.653The ARAs relief operationin Russia began to wind down.654Will Shafroth soon wrote of his experience.655The thing whichgives me the most satisfaction656is the gratitude with whichour help was received,657from the simplest peasantwho would have died658if he had not been fed by America,659from the mother whose childrenate at an ARA kitchen.660These are the people for whomwe brought in the food.661Nowhere was that gratitude greater662than among Russias 14 million Muslims,663who paid Colonel Walter Bella special tribute.664This was an extraordinary moment665when the local Muslim officialsdecide to show Bell...666this infidel...a copy of the Koran.667It was incredible.668They had never shown itto anyone before, to any...669to anyone who is not Muslim.670And they had never shown iteven to Russians,671with whom they livedside by side for many years.672Before he left Russia in July 1923,673Bell, who served longer thanany other ARA supervisor,674was named honorary mayor of Ufa.675He became known as theidol of the Bashkirs.676I feel as though I were a part of them.677I have lived with them throughthe worst period of suffering678they have ever endured.679I have traveled into everycorner of their republic,680slept under their roofs,681broken their bread682and listened to their talesof woe and happiness.683They nursed me through typhus.684I feel as if I am partof their new existence.685Herbert Hooverhad hoped the ARAs efficiency686would inspire the Russiansto overthrow the Bolsheviks.687Instead, it may have savedthe Soviet regime.688He himself in the late 20s689said to a reporter named Henry Wolfe690that he thought he had setthe Soviets up in business.691Now, that was a kindof revelatory statement692for him to make,693because he had sold the programof emergency relief to Russia694as something that would perhapseffect regime change.695Hoover was presidentwhen the Great Depression began696a decade after he rescued the Russians.697As Americans went hungry,698his image as the GreatHumanitarian began to fade.699The story of his Russian reliefwas soon forgotten.700Yet the humanitarian spirit he planted701in the American character lived on.702Hoover was really,in some ways, the vanguard703of that whole approach that hasbecome associated704with America in the last hundred years,705namely that when thereis a humanitarian tragedy706in the world, whether from waror from famine or revolution707or a typhoon or an earthquake,708that Americans will be thereto organize the relief.709The memory ofthe American Relief Administration710lives on in Russia by word of mouth711among the families who were saved.712My grandma told me many times,713Dear Anatoly, do not forget American help714at the time of ournational disaster.715Among those people who weresaved were my family,716family of my father, of my grandmother.717My family will never forget.717Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLESFree Browser extension osdb.linkext"

Times promised,95no army of grimy workers96shall feed the redmouthed furnaces,97for the river, bound with hoops of steel,98shall generate the powerfor numberless industries.99We will be a modern city.100Were not going to be likethose older places101that have these older social problems.102We can remake ourselvesin this new way.103Having, quoteunquote,ended the frontier era,104the West is now going to be105won or lost through its cities.106The rise of faith in the city,its very optimistic.107The mastermind behind the aqueduct108was the head of the Los Angeles Bureau109of Water Works and Supply,110an Irish immigrant who neverfinished grade school.111Well, I went to school inIreland when I was a boy,112William Mulholland told a reporter,113learned the three Rsand the Ten Commandments...114or most of them... made apilgrimage to the Blarney Stone,115received my fathers blessing,and here I am.116He starts out117as a ditch digger.118I mean, you cant start out any lower,119you know, than that.120But thats what made him sucha good field general.121He understands the working man122and how to marshal their efforts.123That was what he lived for.124Angelenos really loved him125because he was a workingclassimmigrant who had made good.126He was the hearty Irishman,127the man of the people.128But the settlers in the Owens River Valley,129the source of L.A.s water,130saw William Mulholland very differently.131As far as they were concerned,he was taking their river,132leaving farms and townsto wither on the vine.133They had been kept in the darkabout the aqueduct134as the city quietly boughtup their land and water rights.135The Owens Valleywas a rural, highdesert community136that had begun settled byEuro Americans in the 1860s.137Their fortunes were tiedto the Owens River.138The water wasnt stolen,139but it was not acquired allin the upandup.140They certainly didnt tellthem that their plan really141was to run the water down to Los Angeles.142The anger in the Owens Valley143would haunt Mulholland to his grave,144but for most Angelenos,any qualms about the project145were eclipsed by itsbreathtaking scale and ambition.146It is a gargantuan construction project147placing metal aqueduct structures148in and around valleys,149arroyos, sheer mountains,150long, flat, dry expanses151of the California landscape.152Its astonishing.153To think that you could bring that water154over 200 miles, thats justextraordinary at the time.155It would be a huge project today.156On that November day in 1913,157when Angelenos gathered at the Cascades158to celebrate the opening of the aqueduct,159they were captivated bythe citys glittering future.160Shortly after 100 p.m.,161Owens River waterwas released down the Cascades162for the first time.163The people just rushed toward the water.164They had brought tin cups to dip165into the water as it was coming down,166to drink the first waterfrom this manmade river.167As the crowdrushed to marvel at their new river,168Mulholland perfectly captured the moment.169There it is, he shouted from the stage.170Take it.171The aqueduct was a game changer.172It made Los Angeles173the fastestgrowing city in theUnited States.174The aqueduct teaches Los Angeles that175it can do bold and amazing things.176Suburbs are springing up all over,177and migrants are pouring into Los Angeles.178It was a moment of great excitement.179Thats not to say this works for everybody180by any stretch of the imagination.181Theres racial segregationin law and in practice.182Theres violence meted out to nonwhites.183So, its not a alchemy184of fulfillment and happinessthat spreads to everybody.185But the mythic qualities of itare palpable.186The dream was come here,perhaps start anew.187But as Los Angeles boomed,188Southern California was drying up.189By the time the populationblew past the one million mark190in the early 1920s,the aqueduct flow had been cut191almost in half by years of drought.192Just think about itthey were looking out 50 years,193and they were out of water in ten.194Surprise, surprise.195Thats what California is full of.196Its full of surprises.197What Mulholland createdwas an illusion of abundance.198And so, the people of the cityof Los Angeles199keep using more water200instead of respondingto drought conditions.201There are lawns everywhere.202Spectacular flower gardens.203The amount of water poured onto those lawns204is pretty astounding.205In orderto quench L.A.s thirst,206the Bureau of Water went onanother buying spree207in the Owens Valley,208laying claim to most of the remaining water209and further underminingthe regions economy.210Theres a tremendous amount of anger211growing in the Owens Valley.212Theres a sense that the community213is really being destroyed.214To see this distant city215turning into a glamorous metropolis...216...and using their water,217must have been incredibly frustrating.218Arrogance absolutely plays a big role.219There is a lot of resentmentthat is driven by the decisions220and the attitudes of peoplelike Mulholland.221The farmers in the Owens River Valley222werent perceived as equal citizens.223They are imperial subjects.224The anger onlydeepened when it became clear225that much of the Owens River water226wasnt going to Los Angeles at all.227Even as the rest of Southern California228was drying up, the city was providing229vast amounts of water to farms230and orchards in the San Fernando Valley,231which belonged in large part to a syndicate232of the most powerful men in the city.233Did the city reallyneed to provide landowners234in the San Fernando Valleywith that much water?235Well, it turns out that theowner of the Los Angeles Times236and some other associateshave bought a lot of land there.237Those wealthy landowners made a killing.238Its very easyto picture Mulholland as corrupt,239but he wasnt doing this becausehe was getting paid off to do it240or he was making money off of it.241I think, for him,its really about his own vision242and his power and his ability243to remake nature.244I think thats whats driving him.245The threat of shortages246accelerated the next phasein Mulhollands master plan.247In a dry year,248if there isnt a lot of snowin the Sierra Nevada,249the aqueduct wont deliveras much water to Los Angeles.250So they need storage,251big reservoir, so you could fillit up in the wet years,252and in the dry years, itll tide you over.253In the summer of 1922,254Mulholland decided to build seven new dams255near the southern end of the aqueduct,256including a pair of majesticconcrete structures257worthy of a great metropolis258the Hollywood Dam, in the hillsoverlooking Los Angeles,259and biggest of all,the St. Francis Dam,260in a canyon 40 miles northwest of the city.261The St. FrancisDam and the Hollywood Dam262are similar structuresthey were both built263with the same design,264a tribute to engineering triumphand the control of nature,265and its impossible not to think266that he saw it as a tributeto him, as well.267Plans were drawn up in Mulhollands offices268in the fall of 1922.26920 years before, the city had required270that a group of experts reviewhis plans for the aqueduct.271But that was then.272This is that sense273that he had earned the right274to sort of do what he wanted to do.275This is thesecondlargest storage reservoir276in Southern California.277It should have had peer review278at least some people outsidehis organization reviewing it279and looking at it.280But nobodys questioning himby the time you get to 1922.281Nobody.282In April of 1924,283the first construction workers arrived284in the San Francisquito Canyon.285It had been 12 yearssince Mulhollands crews286ran the southern end ofthe aqueduct through here,287and three years288since they finished buildinga generating station289called Powerhouse 2290about a mile downstream from the new dam.291The Powerhouse 2 workers and their families292lived in wooden bungalowsclustered around the plant293at the bottom of the canyon.294Now their quiet little community295was overrun with men and machinery.296But just as the project was gearing up,297it suddenly took on a new urgency.298On the 21st of May 1924,299a massive explosion destroyed a section300of the aqueduct in Owens Valley.301The damage was repaired within a few days,302but as far as the activistsin the valley were concerned,303the fight was just getting started.304The aqueductwas a disaster for Owens Valley.305The people who lived therelost almost all of their water.306It became such a desolate place.307It was a complete undoing308of their livelihoods and their households309and their families.310To the cityand to Mulholland, this is terrorism.311You are destroying the water supply312for this major urban center.313Six months after the first attack,314over a hundred men seized315the aqueduct control gates in Owens Valley,316opened up the valves,317and released the wateronto the parched soil.318They wouldnt restorethe aqueduct flow, they said,319until the city agreed to pay reparations320and limit any further expansionof the project.321By noon the next day, hundredsof men, women, and children322had joined the siege,323which had come to look morelike a huge barbecue.324Families came with picnics,325businesses up and down thevalley closed for the occasion,326and a group of musicians arrived,327courtesy of movie star Tom Mix,328who was shooting a Western nearby.329The siege lasted four days,330long enough to make news around the world.331To Mulhollands annoyance,332much of the coverage presentedthe settlers actions333as a noble struggle against the corruption334and power of Los Angeles.335It became knownin the press as the Little Civil War.336And it was intense, and it was violent.337There are multiple layers of irony here.338When the settlers of the Owens Valley339came in the 1850s and 60s,340they displaced the Northern Paiute people,341the Native peoplewho lived in the Owens Valley.342Before contact,343the Paiutes homeland had stretched across34430 million acres of the Western interior.345Although most preferred anomadic lifestyle,346one group settled in Owens Valley,347where the snowmelt coming offthe Sierra Nevada Mountains348provided a reliable source of water.349The Paiutes there,they were building irrigation canals350going back to 1000 A.D.,351so they could take the runoff352from the back side of the Sierra Nevada353and they could grow differenttypes of indigenous crops.354Of course, during the conquest,355theres an influx of whiteAmericans to the West Coast.356For the Owens Valley Paiute, in particular,357theres tension over kidnappingof Paiute children358and other types of really atrocious things,359and theres a series of wars.360In the long run, its,its the Paiute who are removed361from their ancestral landsas the settlers come there362and basically take over theirrigation system363that the Paiutes had builta thousand years before.364So what the settlers did to Native people,365the City of Los Angelesis in a sense doing to them366taking the water away.367The Los Angeles Water Bureau picked up368where the Paiute Wars left off,369insisting that any Paiuteswho remained in the valley370should be removed through a land swap371for humanitarian reasons.372Some are living in dugoutsor crudely constructed shacks373that are a disgrace to American ideals,374an internal report observed,before coming to the point.375Nearly all of them useimmense quantities of water.376Is it a morality tale?377Its always a morality tale.378But of course, it depends on whose morals379and whose perspective.380Dispossession is really woven into381the fabric of the American West.382Its the philosophy that383forms the entire foundation ofthe settlement of the region.384By the fall of 1924,385the canyon was a hive of activity.386Trucks ferried sand and gravel387to a small concrete plant atthe downstream face of the dam.388A crane lifted the liquid concrete.389Workers directed it into position.390Over the next 16 months, thatsame operation would be repeated391tens of thousands of times.392A gravity dams a very simple concept.393Its a retaining wall that youre building394to have something of muchgreater weight and stability395than the forces youre putting against it.396And this is water, this is concrete.397So a dam that has a triangular shape398should be able to hold back alake thats of infinite length.399As work proceeded on the dam,400Mulholland decided to make it taller401than originally planned.402Mulholland had made a promise403that he wanted enough storage404to contain one years watersupply for Los Angeles.405Because the population wasincreasing so much every year,406the demand was greater and greater.407And so Mulholland408increased the height of the dam ten feet409the first year that they werein construction,410and then the second year, he did it again,411without increasing the base width.412Whats important here is, okay,413you can raise the height of the dam.414But if you do this,415theres going to be morepressure on the concrete,416and you better make sure thatits thick enough417to withstand that.418In fact, Mulholland was distracted419by an even more ambitious enterprise.420The Boulder Dam project,421which becomes the Hoover Dam,422is an undertaking thateven dwarfs the aqueduct423to take water from theColorado River, move it424to various places alongSouthern California.425Mulholland is a consultant to that project.426It feeds into his vision of what427he thinks Southern California can become.428Even as the biggest dam hed ever built429was rising in the San Francisquito Canyon,430Mulholland was on the roadfor weeks at a time,431mapping out routes fora Colorado River aqueduct432and lobbying in Sacramento and Washington.433All the while,behind the St. Francis Dam,434the water was rising,the pressure building.435When its completed in the spring of 1926,436theres almost no public notice of it.437There are a number of dynamite attacks438that take place along the aqueduct.439I think they dont wantto draw attention to it.440The officialreticence did nothing to pacify441the settlers in the Owens Valley.442On May 27, 1927, an explosion443ripped out one of the largestsiphons in the aqueduct.444A few nights later,445another 60foot section was destroyed.446By the end of June, there had been447three more attacks on the aqueduct,448and the city was alivewith rumors of a plot449to bomb the St. Francis Dam.450The authorities had yetto make a single arrest.451No one in the valley was talking.452Hundreds of armed guards were sent in.453To locals, they were an occupying army.454Despite the worries about sabotage,455communities that layin the potential flood path456were never consulted about the dam.457The Santa Clara River Valleystretched 50 miles458from the San FrancisquitoCanyon to the Pacific Ocean,459a patchwork of citrus farms and oil wells460that was a magnet fornewcomers seeking work.461There were some groupsthat had been there for generations,462back from the Spanish era463and the Mexican period of the 19th century.464But many were starting to arrive, really,465in the early 1900s,466and especially duringthe Mexican Revolution,467like my grandfather.468Half the peoplein Santa Paula were of Mexican descent,469most of them recent arrivalsworking in the citrus industry.470My greataunt and her husband471were hardworking people.472Poor.473So they had to follow the crops.474Soledad, being the oldest child,475stayed behind in camptaking care of her siblings.476When they would come home,they lived in Santa Paula.477And it was very close to the river bottom.478Not a lot of people knew479of the St. Francis Dam.480Even the ranchers who owneda lot of the orchards,481they didnt even knowthe dam was being built482until the cement was being poured.483You can imagine that theMexican community had no idea.484Thats whats so weird.485I mean, its this major structure.486And its just fascinatingthat theres so many people487who dont really have anysense that its there.488Mulholland gets a call,489I think it was a Monday,490from Tony Harnischfeger,whos his dam keeper.491Harnischfeger washighly attuned to the dams condition.492He and his family lived in the shadow493of the enormous structure.494Over the last year,Harnischfeger had watched495as a series of cracks appeared in the dam.496Those cracks wentall the way through the dam.497There were at least four of them.498And Mulholland plugged all of the cracks499with oakum on the downstream face.500That was the absoluteworst thing you could do,501because now youre taking thathydraulic pressure502and youre putting it onthe interior of the dam.503Harnischfeger was on edge.504The reservoir had been filled to capacity505for the first time five days before.506Water was leaking underthe dams west side.507Mulholland goes out there508right away to take a look at it.509And what he toldHarnischfeger was, you know,510Theres no active erosion511occurring of the dam foundation.512This is a lot about nothing.513Mulholland was back at the office514in time for a late lunch.515But with every passing minute,516the internal stresses onthe dam were multiplying.517At around 1120 p.m.,518the structure finally began to give way.519A huge crack opened upon its upstream side.520This is where that extra height521really makes a difference.522Its kind of like, you know,523straws on a camels back.524This dam did not have the capacity525to stop the loadsthat were being put on it.526The dam was actually tiltingone half of a degree.527Already the St.Francis Dam was fractured by cracks,528and its central sectionwas tilting forward.529Then another defect530in Mulhollands design came into play.531What about water that seeps under the base532of the dam and then beginsto push up at the bottom,533what was termed uplift?534The dam had sort of pushedup off of its foundation.535Like most modern dams,536the St. Francis includedrelief wells to prevent uplift,537but only in its center section.538The wings of the dam werebeginning to slip away.539Around 1130 p.m.,a massive chunk of the dam,540severed by cracks and weakenedby uplift, blew out.541Intensely pressurized water began542jetting through the resulting gap.543The entire east wing wason the verge of collapse.544Over time, waterfrom the reservoir had begun545to saturate the east abutment,546which was made upof this geological formation547called schist,548and its layers of slateliterally stacked on each other.549If it begins to be on an angle,as the hillside was,550and water gets in betweenthese slatelike layers,551it slides like a deck of cards.552At twoandahalf minutes before midnight,553the entire hillside under the east wing554collapsed into the dam.555The dam was sliding on its base.556And the west side crumbled down.557And it collapses.558Tony Harnischfeger probably saw it happen.559Ace Hopewell, smoking a cigarette560a mile up the road,heard it in the distance.561The landslide severed the wires562carrying power to Los Angeles.563The lights in the city flickered.564This huge flow,565close to a million cubic feet per second,566just rushes down the canyon.567For Harnischfeger and his family,568Oh, my God!569Theres no way youre goingto withstand that.570The sound of the collapsing dam571took a little lessthan seven seconds to reach572the cluster of cabins aroundPowerhouse Number 2,573where it woke Lillian Curtis.574She looked out to see575a misty haze hangingover everything.576Suddenly, Curtis grabbed herhusband and screamed,577The dam has broke!578Its a colossalforce coming down the canyon,579not like anything your senseswould ever have understood.580Curtis scrambled up the side of the canyon581with her threeyearold son,while her husband582went back to fetch the girls.583That people had enough time584to try to save their families585and then to fail is,586is a horrifying idea.58740 minutes after the collapse,588the deluge burst out ofthe canyon and turned into589the valley of the Santa Clara River,590where 140 Edison Company workers591were sleeping at an encampment.592The confusion, one man remembered,593was indescribable.594Fewer than half of themwould see the sun rise.595Most of the people who were killed596probably never knew whatwas happening to them.597They just knew they were drowning.598In Santa Paula, tenyearold599Soledad Luna heard shouting outside.600Two motorcycle policemen were going around601yelling, Agua, agua!602My greatgrandfather thought it was crazy.603It hasnt been raining...what water is he talking about?604So my family didnt reallypay much attention605until other neighbors started running.606Precious minutes ticked by607as Soledads fatherand her Uncle Sisto packed608the familys possessions before finally609gathering her young cousins.610Sisto got his children,611put the four oldestin the flatbed of the truck,612and his wife was sittingin the cab of the truck613holding their infant when the water hit.614As the truck toppled over,they could see the little615childrens arms flailing in the water,616trying to grasp, and crying out.617With nowhere to go,618Soledads mother grabbed her four children619and huddled them on the bed.620The first impact toretheir flimsy house apart.621Miraculously, Soledad, her mother,622and her three siblings were carried away623on the crest of the flood,their bed a life raft.624But Soledads luck seemedto run out when her hair625became entangled in the branches of a tree.626Soledad watched her mother and siblings627float away into the darkness.628Soledad screamed,629and her mother triedto grab her and couldnt.630She couldnt see.631It was, it was dark.632But she could hear animals drowning,633people screaming.634And that was so terrifying to her.635As the flood carriedSoledads mother downstream,636it spread across the landscape until637the leading edge was almost two miles wide.638Even so, it still had power enough639to demolish railroad and highway bridges.640Along the way, it hadpicked up all the debris641of the economy of theSanta Clara River Valley.642Orchard trees, cattle.643And as you get to the ocean,644oil from oil drilling.645So its this mix of sludge646and rocks and parts of steel bridges647and bodies and animalsin a kind of an oil slick.648At 525 in the morning,649at the mouth of the Santa Clara River,650the floodwaters finallywashed into the sea.651The next day was gloomy,652overcast.653There was no color at all that morning.654My grandfather walked around.655He remembered housesjust broken into pieces.656Trees uprooted and thrown everywhere.657Cadavers lined up like piles of wood.658Mothers crying, in tears, sobbing.659There were bodies strewn everywhere.660Boy Scouts would go out with little flags,661and when they found a body,662they would put the flag in the ground,663and then a recovery crewwould come and pick up664and carry the body away on stretchers,665put them on the back of trucks,and take them into town.666Rescuers found Lillian Curtis,667her son, and a neighbor on a hillside668overlooking the ruins of Powerhouse 2.669Everyone else in the town was dead.670They found my GreatAunt Irene671where the mouth of the riverempties into the Pacific Ocean.672She was cold and wet,673scared, not able to speak the language.674Soledad was found many,675many, many hourslater hanging from the tree.676It traumatized her so much thatto the very day that she passed,677she could still rememberthe mans name that found her.678It was a Mr. Baxter.679Mulhollanddoesnt get there until hours later.680He stands in shock and awe681and horror,682looking at where theSt. Francis Dam once was.683And all thats left is thiscenter section of the dam.684Everything else from the dam is gone.685Within days,686tourists began showing upat the disaster zone.687Scaling the towering monoliththat became known as688the Tombstone.689Collecting bits of debris for souvenirs.690The sightseers fed a growingbitterness among the survivors.691The haves and havenotsare very finely delineated692during times of distress,during times of disaster.693It makes the inequalitiesin a society very acute.694Searchers foundbodies of ranchers, housewives,695teachers, farmhands, children.696But some of the bodies were lost forever.697We never know how many,698exactly, died that night.699It was a community thathad many transients.700There were migrant workersor migrant families.701And so many of them, maybe,who lived along the river,702who got swept away,703they will never be known.704And the fact that we can never name them705or find out who they are706still haunts us even to this day.707For supporters of Hoover Dam,708the disaster couldnthave come at a worse time.709Just as the Senate was about to decide710the fate of the project,Mulhollands catastrophe711threatened to bringdown the whole enterprise.712The Hoover Dam was the largest lineitem713expenditure in the historyof the United States.714They had the votes tofinally get this thing.715The problem was thatMulholland was the biggest716visible cheerleaderfor that whole proposal.717How can you be sure aboutthe safety of any other dam?718Theyve got to find a wayto deal with this very quickly.719On March 15, two days after the disaster,720California Governor C.C. Young721appointed a commission toinvestigate the dams failure.722Within a week, the commissionannounced that the dam723had collapsed because of a deficiency724in the soil under the west wing.725It was a reassuring conclusion726the failure was an aberration,727unlikely to be repeated.728Its a rabbit trail.729Its not what caused the dam to fail.730But nobody wants toinvestigate it too much.731Meanwhile, the city moved quickly732to settle with the survivors.733The city agreedupon a kind of a fixed price.7345,000 for a human life is not enough.735But thats what was negotiated.736The city paid, very quickly.737They wanted to get it out of the way.738But for Mulholland,the reckoning was just beginning.739Some of the victims haddied in Los Angeles County,740so the county coronerhad to determine whether741a crime had been committed.742Its not a criminal trial.743It was a trial to determinewho was responsible744and to determine if they weregoing to indict anybody.745Its quite possible that William Mulholland746wouldve been indicted for murder.747Eight days after the disaster,748William Mulholland took the stand749at the Los Angeles County Courthouse.750To date, 277 bodies had been found.751Hundreds were still missing.752Mulholland was at times prickly and evasive753under interrogation, but he did, finally,754get to the heart of the matter.755If there is any error in human judgment,756Mulholland admitted, I was the human.757I wont try to fastenit on anybody else.758The fact that Mulholland takes759responsibility for theSt. Francis Dam disaster760allows people not to have toask really difficult questions.761If blame could be put on this individual,762you just remove the individual.763In November 1928, a few weeks before764the crucial Senate vote on Hoover Dam,765William Mulholland retiredfrom the Water Bureau.766It was time for him to move along.767And so long as he did, then he was,768well, he was given a pension.769They hold a banquet for him.770No mention is ever madeof the St. Francis Dam.771In the spring of1929, the City of Los Angeles772erased one of the lastvestiges of the disaster773by obliterating the dams remains.774But it wasnt so easyto get rid of the very775conspicuous reminderof the St. Francis Dam,776and of William Mulholland,in the heart of Los Angeles.777Nobody trusted the Hollywood Dam778after St. Francis Dam went out.779They ended up drawing it down twothirds.780It only holds onethird itsdesign capacity,781and it had a huge embankment fill782added to the front of it.783The monument to784the triumph of man over natureand to William Mulholland785gets buried in dirt.786People in Hollywood nolonger have to be reminded787that there is a huge damlooming over their heads.788Mulholland had a stroke789and his health began to deteriorate.790At family gathering, he would just791sit in the cornerand just stare into space.792William Mulholland died in Los Angeles793on July 22, 1935,794two months before thededication of Hoover Dam.795Heroes serve thepurpose of simplifying stories.796Villains also do something similar.797And in this story,Mulholland is the villain.798Theres lots of other folks, including799the populace of Los Angeles,who voted for the project,800who overwhelmingly supported it.801This is a communal effort.802The St. FrancisDam had largely disappeared803from popular memory,804but it left a deep impressionamong the engineers805who were designing the nextgeneration of public works.806The Hoover Dam807was to be the cornerstone of a new West,808and its creators were809determined to banishthe ghost of St. Francis.810I think a lot of goodthings come out of failures.811We pull back,812we do things more carefully.813St. Francis Dam had ahuge impact on Hoover Dam.814Where the St.Francis Dam had been largely815one mans creation, sketched out and then816altered on the fly,Hoover Dam was scrutinized817by teams of experts at every stage818of its design and construction.819It captured the imagination820as few public works ever have.821Immense dams becamedefining monuments of the age.822The legacy ofthe St. Francis Dam disaster823was a very shortterm moral,824which is, Build yourdams more carefully.825I wish that they had taken826a bigger moral from the story,827which is, Never trust anyone828who tells you thatyou can have it all.829When they said, Yeah,830even though it doesnt rain,the sun is always shining,831we can feed the growingcity of L.A.832and water our crops,833all of them thought thatthey could have it all.834The idea that movingwater from one geography835to another can be doneto such great effect,836to say thats a disastermight be counterintuitive.837But in some ways,838that allowed other regionsto do the same thing.839It got us in the situation were in today.840We can look at Mulholland Dam,or St. Francis Dam,841or Hoover Dam, and we can think of those842as engineering marvels.843But also, all of these things844have led us to an unsustainable future.845People are so optimisticthat technology will solve846these environmental problems847that sometimes we lose sight848of other ways to solve problems.849Were going to have tolearn to manage our resources,850most particularly water.851Where are we going to get it from?852What are we going to do with it?853This story, and as little known as it is,854is a warning.855And it couldnt be more relevant to today.855Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLESFree Browser extension osdb.linkext"

about why5half of the populationof the planet is wearing them6on any given day.7We just are.8Have you ever asked yourself9why everyone you know10owns multiple pairs of jeans?11Dress it up, dress it down...12People know that when they wear them13they look cool.14This one garment can be both15universal and individual at the same time.16There is nothing like thatin the history of clothing.17And, in fact,Yves Saint Laurent said he wished18he had invented jeans,that he thought they were19the most important item offashion in the 20th century.20They wore them in the mines,21on the cattle trails.22My own father wore them toppling200foot Douglas firs.23Jeans are the quintessentialAmerican garment.24120 years later, gentlemen,25blue jeans are still basicallythe same pair of pants26that came out of the California Gold Rush.27But so muchof the story we tell about jeans28is a myth.29The strongest pants the West has ever seen.30It is about the cowboys, and the West,31its about Levi Strauss,32and the Gold Rush.33Its always the same story...34 iBluejean bopi 35 iBluejean bop, baby.i 36After the cowboys, jeans got picked up37by rockers and bikers and hippies38and now everybody wears them.39 iBluejean bop,bluejean, bluejean bopi 40But denim has been around41much, much longer.42It has a long and deep history43with so many other fascinating stories44that are not always told.45In 1850, LeviStrauss invented the toughest pants46the West had ever known47Levis blue jeans.48Blue jeans do represent American culture49to the rest of the world,50but like any other good product of America,51you know, we, we borrow all the best ideas52from, from everywhere.53 iLevisi 54The real fact of the matter is55that blue jeans themselvesoriginated somewhere else.56 iThat Levis weresurely the best things of alli 57 iTo roll out ofAmericas Westi 58 iTo roll out ofAmericas West.i 59The story of denim jeans60is so much more than Wrangler,61its more than Levi Strauss,62especially when it comes to the material.63Were not quite sureexactly where the fabric originated,64but there are several hints.65One is Dungri, India, where asearly as the 17th century,66they were creatinga coarse cloth for workers,67eventually called dungaree.68Theres the Genoans of Italy,69who had a type of sail cloth70that was fashioned into work pants.71And theres Nimes, France,where the cloth there was known72as serge de Nimes.73Not always, but very often,74these various types of clothwere dyed blue,75probably to hide dirt as much as anything.76So, we have blue jean from Genoa,77we have blue de Nimes or denimcoming from Nimes,78but when we make it into pants in America,79we end up morphing the garmentinto blue jeans.80People dont necessarilythink about how their blue jeans81came to be blue.82Historically, thats because ofthe indigo dye.83Centuries ago, indigo was saidto be worth its weight in gold.84Competition for it was so fierceEuropeans actually called it85the devils dye.86Indigo is in fact a weed.87The process of turning indigofrom this small green leaf88into a dye is a very delicate process89so only the most skilledare able to do this.90One of the neatestthings about dying with indigo91is the dye vat is greenits not blue.92And when you introduce a fabriclike denim to the dye vat,93it comes out green.94And then, as it oxidizes inour atmosphere, it turns blue.95It is magic.96Indigo dyeing is magic.97In many cultures,indigo cloth has a spiritual importance.98In Africa, the clothis considered the next layer99to the skin.100It holds the persons soul, their spirit.101Africans have had a long historyof working indigo and knew102the special process involvedin making the dye103and in dyeing cloth.104And of course manyAfrican captives who became enslaved105in the new world brought withthem knowledge of how106to extract the blue from the plant,107and how to fix the blue to fabrics.108Indigo is one of the waysin which slaveholding109became tied to the economic fortunes110of the colonial experiment in the Americas.111So in the mid1700s, there was this labor112that had been extracted from Africa,113and indigo presents itself as this thing114with economic possibility.115And then when you add to it116moving the dye stuff from oneend of the world to the other,117it only increased in value.118And Eliza Lucas benefited enormously119from the impact of this trade.120Eliza Lucas hasbeen credited as literally producing121indigo in America.122Shes been credited as a botanist.123Shes even written aboutin elementary school124and high school textbooks.125Eliza Lucas was thedaughter of a colonial governor.126She had studied botany,127and when Eliza was a teenager,her father bought her,128among many other plants, indigo.129The gift came from perhaps Antigua.130The South needed something131to add to crop rotation, and tobacco132was something cultivated here.133Rice was cultivated here.134Adding indigo into your crop rotation135was a way to find additional profit.136Once Eliza getsher hands on the indigo seeds,137it takes off in terms of production.138Indigo was a second cash cropbehind rice in South Carolina.139And on the eve of the American Revolution,140more than a million pounds of indigo141was being shipped overseas.142Eliza Lucas was probably one ofthe most wellknown producers143of indigo in colonial America.144But Elizas hands werent blue.145She didnt get her hands dirtywith the indigo crop.146The knowledge to grow indigocame from enslaved people.147Theyre the ones that didthe work that allowed her148to become this great planterthat shes been credited for.149Indigo really encapsulates150this problem of how do we beginto tell the story151of captive people and how we document152their contributions in America,153and to the denim history in particular.154We know the names155of all the enslaved people that were owned156by the Lucas and Pinckney family.157Isaac, Pompey,Molly, and their child, Nanny...158Mary and her children,Prince and Be...159These are generations of families.160Were not just talking abouta husband and a wife,161or a mom and a dad.162We see grandparents on this list.163Nanny and her children. Juno...164Theyre the onesthat came from communities that dyed165all kinds of cloth in beautiful colors.166Theyre the ones that hadthe knowledge of indigo167and created generations of wealth for these168white slaveholding families.169Back in the 19th century,170denim really dominated,because its a strong weave.171So with the rise in durable cotton goods,172denim made itself the accepted second skin173in terms of cloth that wasput into clothing174meant for laborious work.175As American cottonmanufacturing begins to sort of176find its footing in the 18teens and 1820s,177mills in Rhode Island,mills in Massachusetts,178mills in New Hampshire,they need a source of cotton.179And the only source of cotton tomake these mills180economically viable181is cotton thats being grownby enslaved men, women,182and children in the American South.183Cotton from Alabama,184cotton from Louisiana,185Texas cotton, Mississippi cotton,186cotton from Georgia,187cotton from Charleston.188It takes two pounds of cottonto make a pair of jeans.189When you followthe trail of cotton being grown190in this country in the South,being shipped to the North,191being woven into blue jeans,192and then being shipped down backto the South,193where is it going?194Whos wearing it?195Theres a database thats calledFreedom on the Move196that has cataloged and crowdsourced197runaway slave advertisementsfrom all over the United States.198So slavers would put an addescribing the person199with detailed descriptionsof what they had on them200when they left.201What clothing they were wearing,what type of clothing,202what color the clothing was.203Had on when he left, darkjeans clothes, and a black hat.204He carried off ablue cloth coat, one blue jeans,205and two or three pairpantaloons.206Has on a blue Kentuckyjeans coat and striped pants.207... wore a brown jeanscoat, and blue jeans pants...208New brown jeans.209Mixed jeans,frock coat, and pantaloons.210A pair of jeans pants.211... a blue jeans homespundress coat.212And so you haveadvertisements that have very213detailed information about enslaved people.214And enslaved people were,in fact, wearing jeans.215This is a story in whichcoerced labor produces a raw material216that is exported from one regionto a second region217and which is then sold backin an ongoing cycle.218An increasing number ofAmerican slaves will come219to be wearing cloth thats manufactured220in the United States, thattravels under a number of names,221that sometimes goes under222an umbrella category ofNegro cloth.223This is one of the powerfulthings about clothing, right?224The ways in which it can beused, not only for individuals225to perform their own identity,but also for the ways in which226a dominant society can stigmatize people.227So blue jeans228clearly existed,clearly predated Levi Strauss.229Youre looking at farmers,230youre looking at factory workers.231Miners were wearing denim.232The enslaved peoples of America233were clothed very often in denim.234Basically any type of labor, hard work,235that you can think ofin the late 19th century,236you would have found people wearing denim.237Jeans did exist,238but they ripped.239They ripped and they wore down240and they became tatters.241They became unusable.242They didnt last as long.243Anybody who has ever torn a seam244through exertion knows245that there are certain pointsin garment structures246that are more stressed than others.247So Jacob Davis is really sort ofthe unsung hero here.248Jacob Davis was a tailor in Reno, Nevada,249or somewhere thereabouts in the 1870s.250Nevada was, you know,one of the great bonanzas at the time.251Theres this enormous rush of people.252And great fortunes are madethere from mining gold.253But the greatest fortunesthat are made there are not made254by individual prospectors.255Theyre made by the peoplewho can sell goods to miners.256So this ladyapproached Jacob Davis and she said,257I have a portly husbandwho continues to rip258his work pants,259and Id like you to constructa sturdy pair for him.260So he thought, Well,I have all these washer261and post rivets that peopleput on these saddles.262Lets add these to all theseplaces he keeps263ripping his pants.264So he adds them to places like265the fly and mouths of pockets,266and even onto the mouth of the back pocket,267which is a patch pocket.268Customer loved them.269Obviously, word of mouth spread.270Soon he had more customersthan he could handle,271and he wanted to scale up the business,272but he was one man in atailor shop in Reno, Nevada.273So he contacted Levi Strauss,274who was his dry good supplierbased in San Francisco,275and offered him a partnership deal.276He said, basically, Lets gointo business together.277We need a patent.278Well take out the patent,279and then we can make these riveted pants,280because you have the wherewithalto scale up.281Levi agreed.282The two of them filed for thepatent, and received it in 1873.283The basic design has not changed284in nearly a century and a half.285Today, every pair of Levi blue jeans286has six copper rivets287that ensure the longevityof each pair of pants.288The rivets were crucial289in the design for durability.290It was like making291some kind of, you know,armor for your body,292that could just hold up to anything.293With the addition of the copper rivets,294the product becomes the mostdurable form of workwear295available to any working American.296Im looking for the ultimate jeans!297Hya!298At the end of the 19th century,299Americans were still largelyworking with their hands.300Nearly 70 of workerswere toiling on farms,301in factories, mines, or construction.302This, of course, createda huge market for jeans.303But jeans initially werent called jeans.304They were called waist overalls.305Overalls were so prevalentin the culture that jeans were306just a truncated version of overalls307without the bib.308Thats where the termwaist overalls comes from.309So 1890,31017 years of patent exclusivityfor this rivet reinforced pocket311by Levi Strauss and Company ends.312Now anyone can use the rivetreinforced pocket that wants to,313and everybody does it.314Once they lose their patent protection,315there are rivets everywhere,316there are knockoff logosand brands everywhere.317So you havecompanies called Cant Bust Em,318Cant Rip Em,319and Never Rip and Never Wear Out.320There were brandscalled Blackbear, Dubbleware, Dozfit.321And Fitsu.322Boss of the Road...323Tuf Nut.324Stronghold...325And so you have all these companies326trying to push their versionof the work pant327out into society,328and we start to see so muchevolution going on within jeans.329We started withone pocket and a button fly.330There were no belt loops.331Most people wore suspenders.332But in mining youcant have a strap over your shoulder333that could get snaggedand cause the mine to collapse.334So several folks had a rope tiedaround the waistband.335Then a second pocket was added,336and there was also a waist cinch.337And then they added zippers...338Belt loops...339There was a rivet at the crotch.340People had been complainingabout it for years.341I think they were happyto get rid of that rivet,342and that has never come back.343Denim was changing344and so was America.345That image of someone cladin denim at the turn of346the 20th century is inevitably,you know, romanticized.347And the reality is that peopleof all different ages, races,348and genders were wearing denimduring this time.349Sharecroppers in the South,350Chinese immigrants on thetranscontinental railway...351As the word of the Gold Rush spreads352not only across the nation,but across the whole world,353people really from all over the world354come through, and often stay in,San Francisco.355Turning San Francisco overnight,356not only into a booming boom town,357but also into a placewhere you have more diversity,358a more cosmopolitan place359than any other spoton the face of the Earth.360There was a hugenativist outcry in San Francisco361at the time...the idea that other people362from elsewhere are coming totake our jobs away.363The backlash galvanizesan immense political movement,364who make it their central platform to365see the expulsion of Chinese labor.366Theres a rise in racismyou do see in the 1880s and 90s...367No Chinaman made your clothes,368and Made by white labor only.369Because Levi wasa San Francisco based company,370they decided, Okay, were nothiring any Chinese people.371Were going to give the jobs tothe local white people.372I think its achallenge for us as we embrace373how we came to be here,374we have to embrace the wholestory and the whole history.375Jeans are a great example tothink about American history376and a way to go into partsof American history377that we havent always addressed.378During the GreatDepression and the Farm Securities Act,379and the contracting ofphotographers to go about380the country to document everyday life,381denim became symbolic of our nation.382You see people on the West Coastwearing jeans,383and people laboringin the ports and the shipyards.384You see people385in the Empire State sitting onIbeams during lunch breaks.386And you see tobacco farmerswith sunfaded overalls387and it became this common identity388that I think helps the country389to still feel unifiedeven during dark times.390Theknives are cutting the load piles high.391The sun beats down from the August sky.392We built our freedom and strength this way.393Were building it still together.394Up until about the 1930s,395denim was really worn out of necessity.396When we get together were hard to stop.397Working together...398It wasnt until thoseyears and beyond that the product399went from a necessity to a fashion.400A lot of that had to do with this nostalgia401for the American West.402Hey, come back with them horses!403Thanks to westerns,404cowboys became the American figure405that kind of helped us get outof the Great Depression406in a way.407We didnt have royalty408like in England and otherEuropean countries,409but we had cowboys410wearing blue jeans.411Thank you so much.412They were our knights in shining armor.413Follow me, maam,and youll never go astray.414Right this way.415Its hard for peopletoday to really appreciate416how big the western was.417As the United States istransformed from being418a rural and agrarian nation419to one in which most peoplelive in cities or towns,420there is a nostalgic embrace421of the frontier world lost,422and the cowboys in thosewesterns almost always423were wearing jeans.424And yet, theres no questionthat when we look more closely425at the ways in which jeanscome into the West,426the story turns out to be muchmore problematic.427The stories we tell are all white people.428In fact, the reality of lifein the American West429was much more multiethnic.430You know, a significant portionof the workforce431were people of color...432people from Mexico,433Native Americans,434African Americansprobably making up an eighth435to a quarter of the cowboy workforce.436So we have a much more complicated reality437that contrasts with the whitening438of those figures in the westerns.439Of course, Hollywoods take on the cowboy440was just the start of denim spreading441beyond the working class.442Now this shift is, is happening443in an era of huge economic schisms.444The vast majority of peoplewere really struggling445during the Great Depression,446but there continued to be447an elite class of individuals.448They still traveled.449They still shopped.450 iIf you want to be a cowboyi 451 iJust come along with mei 452 iIf westward youd be going.i 453One consequence at the time454was that this idea of thedude ranch came about.455The dude ranch was essentially456a getaway, like sort of a spagetaway for wealthy Easterners.457 iGet yourself some wooly chapsi 458 iOr can of beans in pailsi 459 iThen saddle up a wild mustangand head out on the trail.i 460Because of the collapse461of many of the sources of incomebased on cattle ranching462and other traditionalagricultural pursuits,463many working cattle ranches464turned their attention to dudes,465which was a more reliable source of income.466 iThe dude ranch cowhandsdemand the choicest roasti 467 iThey once ate beans and baconbut now its quail on toast.i 468Many of these ranches were very remote.469It might take two weeks to eventravel by train and horseback.470 iYippeekiyayi 471 iKiyayi  iKiohi 472They were expensive.473They accepted paying guests474to participate in all the ranch chores...475to herd cattle, to brand cattle.476 iEach wranglingcowhand is acting as a guidei 477 iHes rounding upthe moonbeamsi 478 iFor the lady at his sidei 479 iYippeekiyayi  iKiyayi 480This was particularlyan opportunity for women.481American society was still notfully comfortable with the idea482of women wearing pants in the 1930s.483Bifurcated garments seemed so unladylike.484Vacationing was a secure laboratory...485especially for the women.486When they looked in the mirror,which I think many dudines did,487they didnt see their old selffrom Connecticut488or Rhode Island489they saw a cowgirl from the movies.490Denim afforded many women theability to get dirty, to hunt,491to fish, to ride horses.492So I think blue jeans on a dude ranch493not only gave women the ability494to move more freely,495to experience their bodiesin different ways,496but perhaps also to sort ofthink more freely,497to rethink their positionin American society.498This was one ofthe first times that women felt499comfortable enough to say,Hey, you know what?500I enjoy wearing that kind of clothing.501Im going to do it.502So the American503blue jeans manufacturersrealized that there was504a substantial market to be conquered505by creating blue jeans lines for women.506So you start seeing the design of jeans507beginning to follow fashion508in a way that they didnt previously do509when they were strictly work pants.510Jeans entered theworld of fashion in the 1930s511because they functioned as a souvenir512and they also functioned as asymbol of wealth and prestige.513Somewhat ironically,the clothes of the working man514became a symbol that youbelonged to the leisure class.515Thats the dichotomysort of represented in the juxtaposition516between the Dorothea Langephotos of the Dust Bowl517and Lady Levis in Vogue.518They can coexist519because there was this extremeinequality in America.520Since October 16, 1940,521millions of American menhave joined the armed forces522to defend our country andour democratic way of life.523For many men and women,524World War II was the first timethey wore jeans.525The minutethe ship left port, neckties were dropped.526The enlisted men wore dungareesand the traditional white hats527were dyed blue.528Here are the men who will fight.529World War II is a moment where530denim goes global in a sense.531One result of Americans fightingoverseas was that the G.I.s,532when they were off duty,533were in many cases wearing blue jeans,534and the locals took notice535and thought, Well,they look like movie stars,536they look cool.537They look like, you know,what we want to look like.538Theres a way in which during the 1940s,539because of the patriotismaround World War II,540denim almost became the blue541in the red, white, and blueof the American flag.542 iThe riveting machinei 543You know and Rosie the Riveter544is a kind of classic example of this.545 iTheres somethingtrue about red, white, and bluei 546 iAbout Rosie the Riveteri 547Rosie the Riveterwas a Norman Rockwell painting548that ended up on the cover ofThe Saturday Evening Post.549She was like the American everywoman,550who when the menfolk were awayfighting the war in Europe,551she pitched in,552she did her part.553 iAll the day longi 554 iWhether rain or shinei 555 iShes a part ofthe assembly linei 556 iShes making history workingfor victoryi 557 iRosie the Riveter.i 558With so many of the men overseas,559something like six million560mothers and daughterswere suddenly going to work561on a daily basis,562and to a large extent wearing denim.563Waitress, salesgirls, housewives...564these girls are now readyto tackle the work565of producing weapons and equipment566essential to our armed forces.567 iRosie, Rosie, Rosie, Rosiei 568 iWorking on an assembly line.i 569 A day of days for America and her allies.570How jubilant was the taste of victory.571How sweet the rewards of peace.572From all the scatteredbattlefields, he returned home573again to find a soldiers welcome.574So, what happenswhen the soldiers who were wearing575denim overseas come home?576They kept wearing denim.577Why not?Theyre great pants.578Theyre comfortable.Theyre durable.579They had gotten used to them.580They liked them.Why not?581As the WorldWar II vets started to come back,582they obviously had been through a lot.583They felt a lot of camaraderie.584They felt a lot of brotherhoodin the trenches.585And they come back586into a very staid,kind of 900 to 500 lifestyle,587for some people it wasnt going to work.588But the combinationof a big motorcycle and denim,589that really works.590 iHe wore black denimtrousers and motorcycle bootsi 591 iAnd a black leather jacketwith an eagle on the back.i 592Theyve all got jeans on.593Tshirt with a cigarette packrolled up in it...594you look pretty tough.595Suddenly bikers have becomemodernday outlaws.596 iWell, he never washed hisface and he never combed his hairi 597 iHe had axel grease embeddedunderneath his fingernails.i 598So the idea of the outlaw,599which has always had600a stronghold on the Americanpopular imagination,601was actually promoted by the movies,602and linked in particular with jeans.603You know, we see that a lot604in the Hollywood of the 1950s,605classically represented by Marlon Brando606in the biker filmThe Wild One.607Brandos character, who was,of course, the guy whos asked,608What are you rebellingagainst?609Hey Johnny, what are you rebelling against?610And he says... What do you got?611Like, I dont know what it isthat Im rebelling against.612Im just doing it.613All bets were off at that point.614A lot of the teenagersmay not have wanted to become615Wally or Beaver.616But my friends call me Beaver.617Well, may I call you Beaver?618Id like you to be my friend.619Okay.620They were able to make the choice,621and part of that choice622was, you know, having jeans on.623The earlyteens are years of upheaval and turmoil.624Theyre years of physicaland glandular change.625Parents of almost every child626find the age of pubertyor early adolescence627full of problems.628After World War II,629really the teenager as we nowknow it came into being.630Their actions may seemexcessive but thats normal for teenagers.631They seem to spend hours incompletely useless activities.632Prior to World War II,633you were either a young personliving at home,634going to school,635or when you were finished with school,636then you entered the workforce.637You were contributing to the family income.638 iYou rockin and you rockinand you rockin aroundi 639 iHop, hop, hop everybodyi 640After World War II,641the middle class exploded.642Families could offer their kids643more leisure time,644more independence.645...the rock and rollteenage cowboy.646The American consumer economy647was booming and it just becamethe American way of life648spend money, buy things,dress up, you know,649move up the food chain.650Gather round, kiddies.651Today Im going to give youa quick looksee652at what the welldressed teenager is doing653in the way of fun and fashion.654If teenagers decided to work,655they could use that moneyfor their own benefit,656for their own leisure time.657They could buy their own cars.658They bought their own records.659They sort of helped create rock and roll.660Teenagers... theyre terrific.661Jeans got sort of662irreparably linked663with cool.664And coolness became the idealto strive for.665Kaysmother may have other opinions of style666of what looks best.667But of course mother hasoldfashioned ideas.668Its like, What mom and dad want to do?669Oh my God.I cant even talk to them.670I do not want to wearwhat theyre wearing.671The adolescent is selfcentered.672The charisma of deviance is powerful.673Their sloppinessis so deliberate as to be offensive.674So during the1950s, denim becomes increasingly675associated with biker gangsand juvenile delinquency.676There was a sort of fear,I think, among adults that677if teenagers put on a pair of jeans,678they were automatically goingto become delinquents679in some way.680School systemsliterally started banning blue jeans681because they identifiedthe kids who wore them682as the bad seeds.683They were going to, you know,beat up a little old lady684and steal her pocketbook or, or whatever.685The parentsgeneration started to clamp down,686which caused a dip in sales.687Suddenly families were688shying away from buying blue jeans.689The denim companies start to get worried.690As a result, a lot of the major companies691band together to form whatthey called the Denim Council.692More people than ever are wearing denim.693Youd have to look far and wideto find an American of any age694who has never worn blue jeans.695So they start thiswhole campaign first to try to counter696the bad blue jean look withthe wholesome blue jean look.697This is the right way to wear jeans,698and its neat with a nice shirt699and this very kind of healthylooking kid.700And then,This is the bad blue jean.701And so its the more the kid702like with his hair hanging down, greasy,703and all that kind of stuff.704Like, see?There is a difference.705You can be a good kid and wear blue jeans.706Denim is really great for sports.707Looks like this jokeris knocking himself out708trying to prove it.709Folks wear jeans to get the work done710and jeans to relax in.711They tried to create a National Denim Day.712They had all sorts of713campaigns around the country714which are all aboutthe discovery of America.715They are about cowboys,716they are about adventure,717and history.718Blue denim isa symbol of our pioneering spirit.719It goes right backto the beginning of America.720Men in blue denim opened up the old West,721and built our bridges and skyscrapers.722That series of advertisements723helped reverse the trendaway from blue jeans.724In the last few months725more applications for thePeace Corps have come to us.726By the first years of the 1960s,727the Peace Corps, JFKs initiative728sending young Americans outacross the globe729to do good deeds,730they were actually dressed in blue jeans.731That was their uniform.732So no longer was it that733the bad kids were the only oneswearing blue jeans.734One thing in particularthats interesting about this period735is the denim companies736spend all this time in the 1950s737trying to get away from the rebel image738and then the 1960s happens.739Hippiesmade a colorful scene with wild costumes,740uninhibited dancing,and general high frolicking.741When we think aboutthe denim story in the 1960s,742we almost automatically thinkof the hippies,743with their bellbottoms, and tiedye,744but the hippies werent the onlypeople wearing those clothes.745A man dieswhen he refuses to stand up for justice.746A man dies when he refuses to take a stand747for that which is true.748So were going to stand up right here.749The classicimage of the Civil Rights Movement750is Martin Luther King Jr.751and he and many of his closest partners752wore suits and button down shirts,753sort of a Sunday best approach.754We will be able to join hands755and sing in the wordsof the old Negro spiritual,756free at last, free at last,757thank God Almighty we are free at last.758Being a man of African descent,759a lot hinged on his selfrepresentation.760He needed to present himself to the world761as a respectable person,762because there was alreadya notch against him763for being a Black man.764The focus on the Sunday best765has obscured the fact thatat that time there were766these young college students who say,767Instead, were going to weardenim because we want to show768that our political bondsare to the Black working poor769and not to the Black bourgeois.770These young people, once theyleft Howard University,771Fisk University,Tougaloo College, to head south,772say, Were going to wearthis denim alongside773the working class andsharecroppers who had been774trying for decades775to fight for their rightto vote.776They were rebels with a cause.777 iFreedomi 778 iFreedomi 779 iFreedom, freedom.i 780For young Blackprotesters, it absolutely is risky781with what theyre wearing782because they already havethe systemic pressure783up against them presuming that they are784of a lower class or status in society.785And so wearing a certain styleof dress that is aligned786with the laboring class,787that is absolutely bold.788 iHold oni 789 iHold on.i 790As this Southernmovement spreads and garners791national media attention,792you now have white studentswho decide to go south793to help with the organizing.794 iWe are all here, Black and whitei 795So when those white students go back north,796they go back wearing denim.797 iHold on, hold on.i 798This becomes the look of youth rebellion799in the 1960s.800 iBaby, dont call me a liari 801They representa new form of social rebellion.802They dress in bizarre and colorful ways.803Hippies are very interesting...804The 1960s is apivotal point in the history of denim.805They are hip, onto something good.806Just like for the Civil Rights Movement,807for the hippies,808clothing was a form of political activism.809Of course its awhole different way of living,810its a whole different way of thinking.811So many of the civilians have no concept.812But its fun.813Its fun to be bizarre.814There wassuch an emphasis with the counterculture815on creativity, on individuality,816selfexpression.817People then embellished their jeans.818They sewed fringe on them...819They put feathers.820They were patched... Painted...821Embroidered and shredded...822All of the sudden your jeans823were your canvases.824There was a cool factor.825And when rock stars andmusicians started wearing denim,826it became even cooler.827There was The Who, and Janis Joplin,828and the Doors, the RollingStones, Led Zeppelin.829So then everyone wanted to wear them.830 iBy the time we got to Woodstocki 831Woodstock... that movie832completely expanded our idea of fashion.833I know for me being this kidin North Carolina,834when I saw that movie, Im like,835I want towear clothes like that.836 iA little helpfrom my friendsi 837Denim was the uniform of that generation,838and a lot of the denim companies839started to capitalize on that.840Its interestingto look at that case study of Levis,841because in the 1950sthey tried so hard to get away842from the counterculture.843And then by 1971,844they use an aerial shot of the crowd845at a music festival846and just slap a Levis logoon it, and thats it!847Its been saidthat Those children of the 60s848came in as a tribeand went out as a market.849They were the market for blue jeans.850By the time you get into the early 70s,851hippie chic is everywhere.852The fashion industry becomes wildly taken853with these young radicals.854You have designers with adsthat suggested that,855The real freedom movementis in your jeans.856It is ironic, isnt it?857Rewind like a decade earlier,858youth were sort of wearing denimas a form of rebellion.859By the time we get to the 1970s,like denim is being commodified.860The fashion industry coopts861authentic subcultural styles862and then makes them part of the system.863Whether it seems dangerousor seems totally trivial,864the fashion industry takes anycool look or stance865and markets it if sees an audience for it.866We start to seedenim jeans become just a very867lucrative product.868They were really a great blank canvas869for designers to express themselves.870When I was 16 years old,871I was enamored with music and musicians,872and I couldnt playso I couldnt be a musician,873but I wanted to look like a rock star.874So I opened a small shopcalled Peoples Place875and started selling jeans.876At one point I was thinking,I think I could design877better jeans than were buyingfrom vendors.878The fashion industry realizes879that theres this massive market880for all things denim.881Now its sleek, highrise, tight...882There becomes a certain kind ofglamor associated with jeans883for the first time.884It was a turning point,885which became the era of designer jeans.886There was Gloria Vanderbilt,887Calvin Klein...888There was Halston... Sasson...889 Fiorucci... Sergio Valente...890We were really trying to outdo891one another with sexiness.892But when Brooke Shields, as a young teen,893was the Calvin Klein postergirl, I think heads turned.894You wanna know what comesbetween me and my Calvins?895Nothing.896Calvin Klein Jeans.897Everyone said,Okay, well, this is going to898a whole new level.899 iYouve got thelook I want to know betteri 900It is like a tidalwave over the whole industry.901People started actually902verbalizing what everyonehad known for a hundred years,903that blue jeans are sexy.904 iJordachehas the fit thats right.i 905By the late 70s, designer jeans906were chipping awayat the fashion hierarchy.907They make it acceptable for anyone908to wear a pair of jeansat any time or place.909Jeans undermine the ideaof what fashion was supposed to be.910They were part of a more generaldemocratization of fashion.911It suddenly became possible to wear jeans912in almost all settings.913 iHip hip hopand you dont stopi 914 iWe rock it out, baby, boppato the boogity bang bangi 915 iBoogie to the boogie,the beati 916In the late 1970saround the Bronx in New York City,917we start to see hip hop emerge.918And denim jeans become thissort of a uniform.919 iYou see Im sixfoot one and Im tons of funi 920 iAnd I dress to a Ti 921 iYou see I got more clothesthan Muhammad Alii 922 iAnd I dress so viciouslyi 923For African Americans,a pair of designer jeans924came with a lot of value.925Thats why we get languagecoming straight out of hip hop,926like fresh, dope, fly.927 iAnd the rest is FLYi 928You know, because that spoketo the value of clothing.929 iEverybody go hotel...i 930Hip hop changed denim in a very big way.931The hip hop stars started goingon tour and doing MTV videos932wearing really cool clothes.933The way in which it was wornwas very different.934 iOh my Lordi 935 iAnother corn chopped by theWuTang swordi 936 iHey hey heyi 937In the early 80s, with bands like Run DMC,938its just more of a straight look,939but then it becomes more baggy.940 iBlow up your projectthen take all your assetsi 941 iCause I came to shakethe frame in halfi 942And then they startedto wear brands like Ralph Lauren,943and Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger.944Those brands represented a lifestyle that945historically African Americanshad been excluded from.946I want to thank Snoop Doggy Dogand everybody on the show.947So wonderful...948I mean when we think about those brands,949we think about the country clubor yachting.950 iTommy Hilfiger top geari 951 iTake no shortsIm doing lovely in all sportsi 952 iEven swing the pole at thehole in my golf coursei 953By putting a brand like954Ralph Lauren or Tommy Hilfigeron their backs,955they were changing the meaningof the brand.956This brand thats associated957with allAmerican identityor whiteness becomes associated958with like hip hop culture.959 iK7 and The Swing Kidsi 960 iDa ding de ding de dingde de de ding dingi 961 iDa ding de dingi 962 iDe ding de de de dingi 963 iDe de de ding dingde de de ding dingi 964Not only do wesee hip hop artists able to remix965sounds, and, you know,966like in music, but theyre alsoable to take clothing967and remix it for their own means.968 iYeah, yeahi 969To get your handson that clothing and wear it970is subversive in a way.971Because it is saying, Im notsupposed to be wearing this,972but look at me, I am.973Hip hop really helped to take command974of the denim narrative.975Bring it!976K7 and the Swing Kids!977Peace!978Jeans are probablythe single most iconic garment979of the 20th century.980Each generation981keeps rediscovering how jeanscan be meaningful for them.982Blue jeans are an amazing thing983for anyone trying to tell984a broader history of the United States.985It allows you to talk about slavery.986It allows you to talk aboutfashion and consumerism.987It allows you to talk about cooland the invention of cool.988And to have all of these thingsunder the same heading989is really quite remarkable.990Denim and its history is a perfect metaphor991for where we find ourselvesas a culture right now.992Becoming much more aware of the silences,993of those groups994that have been pushed to the side.995Exposing and celebrating996these narratives that havent made it into997that typical telling of jeans998is part of the work to changeour understanding999of American history.1000Its a long journey from Negro cloth1001to hip hop denim and baggy jeansruling the denim market1002in the 1990s.1003As I sit here in a denim jacket,you know, its clear to me that1004we can see the rich tapestryof where weve been as a people,1005as a nation.1006The thing about the denim jean1007is it tells a story about who we are.1008Its a garment thats almostlike keeping the fingerprints1009of our history...1010the creases, the tears, all of it.1011You know, you can repair it all you want,1012mend it all you want,but the scars of that, you know,1013the memory, that material memory1014will remain there.1015Support us and

I dare you.557Sorry, sir.558I want you to run to City Halland bail out Mrs. Goodbody.559Yes, sir.560In about two hours.561Yes, sir.562I once wenton an anthropological expedition...563...to study the Kwakiutl Indians.564In winter, one Kwakiutl in a blanket froze.565But two Kwakiutls in the same blanket...566Yes?567Were warmer.568Would you hold this, please?569Champagne?570You put alcohol in the radiatorof the automobile...571...to keep it from freezing, dont you?572I cant see a thing.573Neither can I.574Maybe we better stop.575I cant stand it, Im freezing to death.576Shut up!577Even the thermometer is frozen.578Everythings frozen.579Look at that!580It wont take long to grow back.Its only a half of a mustache.581What was that?582I dont know.583Well, Ill go see.584Miss Dubois, please.

Something like that.85Our audience became broader.86Usually, theres a lot more men,and bachelor men,87you know, and like five women.88And theyre just like...89You know, like...90It really makes womennot want to go.91And so we started workshopsfor women,92so we could get themto feel more comfortable.93I invite youto come forward, yeah?94Come forward, stand up.95Shamanism and energy workis an important aspect of,96you know, the anarchy movement.97The thing is thatits super male,98its a lot of male energy.99It definitely needsthe other aspect of it,100the heart, creativity,101and an intuitionkind of balancing it.102We started to getmore attendees that were women.103Workshops were full.Everything was full.104Hey, hey, were here atAnarchapulco105with the bit coin.com.Hey!106Tons of energy, cameras,107you know, interviews happeningall over the place.108But, yeah, this has got...Definitely taken on a life109of its own now,and its a very...110We have public dataand then we have private data.111Our conference hada lot more sponsorship.112Its never been easier to reap113the rewardsof cryptocurrency mining.114Like Bit Club.115Ive been blessed to be ableto come back,116year after year and speakand talk117about all the cool projectswere doing.118We had a lot of big names.119Weve got motherfuckingRon Paul in the house.120If you become awareof these things,121then you have a moral obligationto do something about it,122and that is to spread a message.123So, we just realized.124WuTang Clan is hereto learn about crypto125and theyre gonnaperform tonight.126The energy was so overwhelming,127in a positive way.128It was a paradise for anarchistsand freedom lovers.129During Anarchapulco that year,130I felt like a fishout of water, I hated it.131Oh, look, were gonnatake over this hotel132as anarchists.133Like, Look at how big we are,look at how big we are,134look at how big we are!135Everybody was cocky as hell.136Everybody hadextra money to burn,137so they were burning it.138We were all highon crypto, right?139And so, everybodywas feeling like a baller,140money was moving around,it was a big party.141Theyre all like,Im fucking gods,142 you know, Were the shit! Were all the shit!143Most people areat the weird vibe beach party.144I dont wanna be immersedin this vibe145because Anarchapulcois just getting more of that,146like, you know,147Lets be rock starstype of thing.148It was almost likea reinforcement of like,149this is why Im doing the Fork.150If Anarchapulco becomes151about being on vacationwith people152that call themselves anarchists,153well lose the whole ideathat it was born around.154John and Lilyscheduled Anarchaforko155to happen just one weekafter Anarchapulco.156The conferenceswerent affiliated in any way,157so the success of the Fork158hinged entirely on their abilityto promote it themselves.159I was just so exhausted.160Socializing and getting peopleexcited about Anarchaforko.161We did not attendany speakers this year,162yeah, we had too much to do,managing our lives163and getting ready for the Forkduring the daylight hours.164Most of the timewe were getting here165just as the sun was going downand were almost here166until the sun was coming up.167I literally disassociated168my waythrough that entire conference.169And then, like, Paul was tryingto be a little mini kingpin.170Selling cocaine at Anarchapulco.171I dont know where Paul foundthat source, honestly,172but he had the sourcebefore he moved in with us.173We though he could bestealthy enough, you know?174So, we had him sellingour edibles too.175So, like, the idea was,he was going to get176peoples contact informationand meet them places,177and like do it realdecentralized, like,178and try to not even dothe drug sales179on the propertyof The Princess if he could.180But Paul couldnt do anythingwith subtleness181that wasnt in his vocabulary.182He went to the venue, and like183he set up shopin some dudes room.184He had all the party favors.185He got his hands on everythingand was distributing186to everybody to make sureeveryone had a good time.187Everybody was like, Have youtried Pauls cocaine yet?188Like, Id be talkingabout the conference189and people would be like,Have you tried Pauls cocaine190Paul even posted flyersfor his services on Facebook,191using an alias accounthe created under his alter ego.192Shepard Spook.193We told himit was a stupid idea,194but we couldnt doanything about it.195He was so obvious,everybody knows who he was.196He was upfor days on end, using.197He wasnt necessarily groundedto reality.198John and Lily invited usup to the room199where Paul was working.200But they insisted we absolutelycould not film anything.201He would set up a table,like, with his wares202wait for people to knockon the door203and come inand order their drugs,204sometimes do them.205Its almost like, dude, youre noteven supposed to be staying there,206like, you dont stay there.207Youre supposed to leavewith the drugs208and go somewhere off site,like, thats Drug Dealing 101.209Lily told us repeatedly210that, although, Paul was sellingcannabis products for them,211he was selling cocainepurely on his own.212But they all seemedto be taking a huge risk.213Paul started gettinginto straightup214like chases and stuffwith their security team,215cause they were tryingto get rid of him.216Because he was our roommate,217he would come upand hed talk to us,218so the security startedwatching us too.219And it was just like220this is not okay.Not okay at all. We were pissed.221When you run a conferencein Acapulco,222when you have a lot of Americansshowing up223to a touristy place224theyre gonna want to party.225And so,we got to know the people226that would supplyour conference.227Nathan received a phone callfrom our supplier.228He said that there are gringos229in a hotel room selling cocaine,230and Were coming in,theyre done.231Nathan said, Can you pleasenot do that at the conference?232Let me go talk to them.233Nathan told them,you need to stop234or theres goingto be serious consequences.235They stopped,236so we didnt end up havinga shootout at the conference.237Kym and I went in that room.238So... so... you...You... you can contest to239that they were selling drugs,right?240We dont know. We were there, theyinvited us,  You... but you knew...241But my memory was John and Lilywere just hanging out in there242and they were doingsome drugs. Um...243 As far as selling... Mmhmm.244I didnt see themactually doing anything.245Well, thats the best part.246The people in chargedont do the stuff.247They have somebody else do it,248so then theyrenever doing anything. Yeah.249Did you pay mefor the ICO thing?250Well, well, hes going on now.251But he wasnt here,so, we had to break.252What?253 Jeff... Ladies and gentlemen,254 please take your seats, were about to begin..

Okay, go.260So, um261theres an articlethat just came out today.262In it, he called me a, Recluse,263watching the conferenceon live stream264from his mansion in the hills,is what he said.265And I laughed at it firstbecause it sounded like crazy,266like Im Howard Hughesor something.267But then I thought about it,Im like,268Well, thats actuallywhat Im doing,269so, am I a recluse?Is that what I am?270I dont know.271Ive actually beena little depressed272the last couple of days.273Like, there must be a reasonI feel that way, right?274Now I have to think about that,why do I... why do I feel so alone275when Im surroundedby so many people?276And Ive realized, a lot of themstem from my childhood.277I blocked out a lotof my childhood.278I dont really remember a lot.279I had no friends, really.I was a computer nerd,280I was always getting beat upat school.281And my dad said maybe 30 wordsto me my whole life,282and it was usually Shut up.283I was just like, you know,15, 16. And all of a sudden284I actually got all this angerinside of me.285I learned how to ignoreall my emotions.286Im going throughso many changes,287and so, this is like...288You know, Im not drinkingat this conference, and, uh289without the alcohol,290I just dont want to be aroundpeople and talk to people.291His closing wordsfor this conference292are about to come,listen to this293as we welcome, Jeff Berwick!294Nathan learned very quickly295that Berwick wasnt somebodyhe could rely on,296and he became a babysitter.297Basically, Nathan did everything298and Berwick really,once in a while299would say, How are things?300So were at the endof Cryptopulco here301Ive actually been watchingmost of the speeches302all throughout Anarchapulco...303With Nathan,you could see he really believed304in what he was doingand he cared305about trying to organizea thousand things at once306doing a million things that reallyshouldnt have had to be his job.307Instead of going,That isnt my job,308which almostanybody else wouldve309because he so much believedin the underlying goal.310I knew I could do it.311Nathan was getting exhausted.312It started to get on the familybecause hes absent,313completely absent from the kids.314Ira Belle was a baby,315so I was in a differentstresslevel mode for sure.316It just became moreand more clear317how much the conferenceaffected us, personally.318Ill see them during the day.319Axiom would run up to me.Hed be, like, Daddy!320And hed give me a hugand Id be like,321Hey, sorry, I gotta go!322I... I think at one pointwe literally had this exchange.323Im a single mom taking careof three kids.324 Yep. Im a single dad325taking care of 1,700 kids.326Its my role as an activist327to... to help facilitatethis vision.328Were tryingto change the world.329Is there a limit330to the sacrificethat youre willing to make331to fix the broken world?332Welcometo SmartCash Smart Talk Radio.333And we have Lily and John334with Anarchaforko.335How would you like to introduceour audience to Anarchaforko336and tell us what its about?337Honestly, um, most peopledont understand it yet.338Its kind of a completelydifferent idea,339cause everybody with a ticketcan add an event.340You know, its not up to us,341its up to themto do it themselves.342That we want to give peoplethe opportunity343to sculpt the experiencethey want out of Anarchaforko.344The whole idea of this thing345is its supposed to bethe participants346that do mostof the actual content.347They all seemed to waituntil the last minute348to advertise349what they were doing.So, to us organizers,350it almost seemed likenothing was going to happen.351Whoo!352Were most excited to seejust what people put on353and what peopleare interested in.354Ive had so many people355come up to me today,356and I was evena little worried myself.357Theyre like,What are we doing today?358And I was like, Well, maybeI should look on the schedule.359So that way,the more we use the system,360the more financiallywe benefit from it.361There was everything from like,362workshops on aromatherapyto like jam sessions.363It was pretty much likeall the stuff364that people were sayingthat they wanted to do365at Anarchapulco,but that Anarchapulco366was currently too big to do.367You start to reorganize stuff368from the inside,369you are making changeon the outside.370So, thats why Im sayinghow we could bring371more anarchy into the world,372 is actually by... Yep.373Honoring these thingson the micro level...374This was completely freeand voluntary375and selforganized.376And it was spontaneous!Thats the thing.377I loved it.I love the idea,378I love the start to it,it was humble.379It wasnt, you know,this extravagant thing.380Its kind of your baby,381so you always want moreand whatnot,382but we definitelywerent disappointed383with the numbers we got.It was above our minimum,384to consider it a success,385so we were happy with it,you know?386Yeah.387This is the OG Broncnutzfrom the 719 West West,388still down hereand Anarchaforko,389were with someSmartCash developers,390which I told yall391I was gonna bring.392SmartCash sponsored us.393SmartCash is like a forkof Bit coin.394And they sentrepresentatives and everything395as part of,you know, the package.396Well, Paul, being what he was...397You wanna try some cocaine?You wanna try some cocaine?398You wanna try some cocaine?399It was literally to everybody,including our sponsors.400After that, SmartCashjust wasnt really around.401We just thought they were flaky.402We started to, like,plan the next one403and we contacted SmartCash,and theyre like,404Were not interestedbecause of this guy,405who said he representedyour event. Were like,406He had nothing to doother than that he was there,407and that he was stayingwith us at the time.408That was the pointwhere John and Lily just decided409they didnt want anythingto do with him.410They locked him out.411They didnt want himthere anyway412and they didnt give him a keyand they made sure413that the doors were locked.414And then you step in.415Yeah, well, I... I...yeah, actually.416I didnt say,You can stay with me.417He just says, I gotno place to go, brother,418they put my stuffout in the street now.419We picked up his stuffand put it in a van420and moved it down to my house.421I took him in because I felt bad422and we were broy.423And John said, Dont let himmove in with you.424And Im thinking, Dont tell mewhat to do, you know,425like... like,what are you doing?426We were just like,Why are you helping him?427And he was like,Somebody has to.428And were like, Good luck!429It seemed thatthese two divergent visions430of an anarchist conferencecould potentially coexist.431But this new foundationthat the community432had built itself onwas beginning to crack.433Bit coin has fallenfrom 16,000 dollars434to, currentlyits about 9,000 dollars.435Bit coin continuesits steep slide436down more than 20 percent.437How low can Bit coin go?438Today we will, of course,be talking about439the latest dropin the crypto markets.440Bit coin wasslowly declining in value441ever sinceits peak the year before.442We need to find a bottom,443and then once we find a bottom,we build a foundation444we go up.Thats how it works.445But still hungoverfrom 2017s crypto euphoria,446the movement doubled down.447Im holding on to my damn coins,Im not giving up!448The fact of the matter isthat this is a completely normal449market retracementto a wild and crazy 2017.450Scared money dont makeno money, man. Fuck it!451Its just so hard for meto fathom Bit coin452going that low, honestly.453The time to buy454is when theres bloodin the streets.455The blood is in the streets.So, what are you gonna do?456Despite the hopefor a longterm rebound,457the communitys crypto lifebloodwas being drained458threateningtheir forward momentum.459Anarchapulco puta lot of stress on our family.460Every year, its kind of like461when you have children,you forget the first six months462after theyre born.463 Yay! Yay!464So, youre like,Oh, you know what,465lets have kids, and you forget466what... How muchof a struggle it can be,467um, so you keep doing it again.468 Youre really hungry? Yeah.469 What would you like to have? I dont know.470 Wait, what if we put... I dont know how to make I dont know.471Were actuallyout of I dont know.472Yeah, I know...473You were feeling nauseousthroughout the day.474Yeah, Id wake up shaking,and go to bed crying.475Id have nightmareswhere we were about476to start the conferenceand I realized Id forgotten477to buy any of the plane ticketsfor the speakers.478Or like you didnt have pants,479and, you know.480Drink?481Im having one.482He was getting exhausted.483I told him it was timethat we started484getting some helpwith the conference.485And I really pushed.486Im like, We need to getsomebody professional487to be sort of morein the background488doing the logistics.489And you can do the big stuff,490and, you know,we can do the ideas491and the management,you know, aspects,492but, logistically,we need to start delegating.493Jeff agreed we neededto have more people involved494and we wanted to bring onsomebody fulltime.495And I suggestedbringing on Dayna Martin.496Hi, everybody.497She had such a deep background498with Anarchapulco.499She had been to all four eventsup to that year.500Im here tonightwith Larken Rose501and Amanda Rachwitz. Hey, guys!502 Hi. Hey.503She knew the speakers,she knew the audience.504I think that compassionis an instinctual505emotion within us,were born with it...506And she has great creative ideas507about how to set up eventslike this.508Berwick had somebody elsein mind,509her name was Jessica Kill.510She approachedJeff Berwick and said,511Ive got all this experienceproducing events in Hollywood,512why dont you let me helpproduce Anarchapulco next year?513And she was already embeddedin the conference514through Bit Club.515She was their mainlogistical person.516She seemedprofessionally competent,517definitely assertive.518Jeff and I agreed that, yes,519these are two people wed liketo add to the team.520This is really wonderful.Im really excited.521So, for those of youwho dont know me,522Im Jessica Kill,Im one of the producers523on the team for Anarchapulco.524Im the community producerof the event.525Such an honor to be herewith you on Facebook Live...526Dayna was offered,like an assistant job527because she didnt haveas much experience528in coordinatinga conference the size529of Anarchapulco.530So many thingsjust came together.531Ever since Anarchapulco,Paul was using... a lot.532I dont think he slept that wholetime, and I think that took a toll.533And I thinkafter what happened to Gino,534he got worse.535Gino was one of Pauls friendsin the community.536They were both military vets.537They both battledand they both saw things538a certain way and they couldspeak a certain language539and theyd understandeach other.540Paul took a liking to him541because he was anothermessedup guy.542Paul kind of had this kinship543with people who werejust a little screwy.544They both have drug problems545and they would train together,546like he would join themfor workout sessions547at the Anarchastle.548Gino was being very aggressiveand belligerent.549And in Acapulco, like,if you get aggressive550and annoying for long enough,551eventually someoneis gonna deal with you.552Gino got into a fightand got killed.553Do you know what happened?554I was told he pickeda fight with a few guys555and then they crushed his head.556Those who know Gino,557know how deep he cut me.True soldier.558You understood me.559You stood with methrough my hell.560Ginos death just compounded561all the frustration and anger562that Paul was dealingwith all the time563bored off my ass, and madefriends with this old man564with society565his past experienceswith bad relationships.566It just added on topof the mess that Paul was.567Paul, like,he did not get over Gino.568I realized after that,that theres a lot of bloodshed569in the city, just all overthe place, all the time.570We started following that page571where they reportall the murders and stuff,572Lo real de Acapulco.573We also kind of realized574just how bad it waswhen we went to that cemetery575at the top of the hill.576Youd find entire familiesthat had died on the same day577buried in the same plot.578Paul was very rapidly declining.579There were times where youdjust see him weeping,580and there were other timeswhere hes just feeling violent581and he wanted to fight.582There was always justthis roller coaster with Paul.583He put his whiteboardin my living room584and started drawing up plans,and nonstop talking585about how he was gonnatake advantage or hurt somebody.586I had mentionedin passing with Paul one time,587that my exwife hadlife insurance policy588that pays out to me.589He saw that I was sad sometimes,590and he really wanted to help me,in his own bizarre way.591He kept...offering to592kill my exwife.593And I was just like, Id ratherbe broke in a ditch, dude,594let it go.595And then over three weeks,596he got moreand more serious, so...597I decided to... I had to leave,598for a little whileuntil things cooled down.599My plan to get outof that situation600was to use my mothers birthdayas an excuse601to come back to the States.602And just get away from him.603Is that music I hear?604Oh, did I not bring my phone,I dont need my phone, do I?605Here.Let me have your hand.606Oh, gosh, I just realized607just how emotional Im gonna beby the time we get down there.608Well, because609were gonna be in frontof all our favorite people,610and mommy and Iare gonna talk about611how much we love each other612and how happy we areto be together.613The energy of the conference614was so overwhelming.615Nathan and I were like,we need a fresh start.616We never really hada fancy wedding.617I wanted to dothe big wedding later,618after weve stayed togetherfor a while.619Like, lets provethat this is for real.620Thank you.621I just...

Like, I was trying to,747like, influence himin a good direction.748I really advocated for him749to do labor on a, like,a fruit farm kind of thing,750you know? And you just...A chance to restart a new life.751You know, even in Mexico,I researched.752I had done this research, causeI wanted to present solutions.753But he didnt want anyof the solutions,754any of the ideas.755So, at that point,I had been in Acapulco,756you know, over two years,I think two and a half.757Um, and I... I was758wanting to rest and recover.759Erika left Acapulcoand moved to Belize760to restart her life awayfrom the turmoil761of the community.762I dont knowwhat the percentage would be,763but its like blindingly White.764I stared to feelan accumulative effect765of being so other.Im the other other.766Im like expat,but even among the expats,767I still dont necess... You know,768Im still aware that yallare having conversations769that you hold for when I leave.I know this.770And I just thoughtthat there could be771more represented than...than just drama and crypto.772There were all these variables,like volatile things,773unpredictable things,dangerous things,774and theyre all, like,kinda like, being juggled.775I dont really... I dont know,I could not keep account776of whose hands threwwhich balls.777I just know that there were allof these factors,778and that...779Theres... Something is... somethingwas gonna implode eventually.780Theres a Telegram group781all about the communicationof everybody782in the production teamfor the conference,783and Nathan was blocked.784He was no longer allowedto be in this group.785And then he was cut outof Anarchapulcos email.786Nathan and Iwere really concerned787that there was somevery sketchy stuff788happening behind the scenes.789Im here with Nathan Freeman,in beautiful Acapulco, Mexico.790Nathan Freeman, he runsthe Anarchapulco conference791with Nathan Freeman,the chief cat herder.792 Great to see you, man.

Like...823But Jessica Kill, shes like,I got spreadsheets.824She was really goodwith times and money,825like a real pro personwho knows how to run events.826He decided that she should be827the executive producer.828He described it as a CEO role.829Which was a little weird,830cause I was like,Huh, then what am I?831That makes no sense.832The guy whos been running itfor three years,833youre gonna push out,834when hes the onethat has all the information835on how things run?836He kinda felt like it was,like, his thing.837And its not even,like my thing, really,838like, I just want itto run well.839Kill sold him on her ability840to delegate and be in controlof a conference.841It never sat well with him.842And I think he kinda felt843like I ran himout of Anarchapulco, but844that really wasnt the case845and, I dont know,it just got a little weird.846Just weird.847Bit coin gettinga beatdown today,848falling below 5,000for the first time849in more than a year.850Now down 25 percent851and just to 300 bucksin the past hour.852If youre lookingat the market right now,853youre probably freaking out.854Crypto crash!855Dawgs, look at Bit coinalltime low,856why is the price falling so low?857Holy fucking shit!858Im losing everything, bro!859Near the end of 2018,860cryptocurrency pricesbottomed out.861Bit coin plungednearly 17,000 dollars862from its peakjust one year before,863bringing the restof the market down with it.864It was tough,I was working hard.865Not a whole lot of moneywas coming in.866And the conferencehad a problem,867which is, where do you getthe money from?868And the money is comingfrom sponsors.869And who are the sponsors?870Well, theyre crypto projectsthat are looking for attention.871SmartCash sponsored us big872when they were overa dollar coin873and then they werea quarter of that.874And then it was just like,875Well, we got no moneyto sponsor you.876And youd just hear iton social media, like,877Id like to go, but, you know,I just...
